<p class="caption1">THE PREPARATION OF ILLUSTRATIONS FOR REPORTS OF
THE United STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.</p>


<p class="caption2">By John L. Ridgway.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="PART_I" id="PART_I"></a>
<span class="smcap">Part I. Preparation By Authors.</span></p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>
INTRODUCTION.</p>


<p>There has been an obvious need in the Geological Survey of a paper
devoted wholly to illustrations. No complete paper on the character,
use, and mode of preparation of illustrations has been published by
the Survey, though brief suggestions concerning certain features of
their use have been printed in connection with other suggestions pertaining
to publications. The present paper includes matter which
it is hoped will be of service to authors in their work of making up
original drafts of illustrations and to draftsmen who are using these
originals in preparing more finished drawings, but it is not a technical
treatise on drafting.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of illustrations does not depend entirely on good
drawings nor on good reproduction; it may be due in large part to
the inherent character of the rough material submitted. If this
material is effective or striking the finished illustrations, if well made,
will be equally effective and striking. Each step in the making of an
illustration&mdash;first the preparation of the author's original or rough
draft, next the final drawing, and last the reproduction&mdash;is closely
related to the others, and each is dependent on the others for good
results. If the material has been well handled at all three steps the
resulting illustration should be above criticism; if it has been poorly
handled at any one of the three the effectiveness of the illustration
is either impaired or ruined.</p>

<p>A consideration of processes of reproduction is essential in the
preparation of all illustrations, and the influence or effect of the
process to be selected on the methods of preparing a drawing has
seemed to warrant the presentation of brief descriptions of the processes
usually employed by the Geological Survey. These descriptions
include statements as to the kind of copy that is suitable for
each process, the result produced by each, and the relative cost of
the processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="PURPOSE_AND_VALUE" id="PURPOSE_AND_VALUE"></a>
PURPOSE AND VALUE OF ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>


<p>An illustration in a report of the Geological Survey is not merely
a picture having a remote bearing on the subject matter of the report;
it must represent or explain something discussed or mentioned
in order to become an illustration in the true sense of the term. The
illustrations used in the Survey's reports are not employed for embellishment;
the more pictorial kinds may be in some measure decorative,
but decoration is distinctly not their primary purpose. The
illustrations used in popular literature are designed to meet a public
demand for ornament or attractiveness. Those used in scientific
publications should be made plain and direct, without attempt to
ornament or beautify. In the literature of science illustrations made
by the reproduction of photographs or of explanatory diagrams or
maps are intended simply to furnish greater illumination, and if the
illustrations display photographic reality most statements or conclusions
thus illuminated seem less open to dispute. A photograph
may thus serve the double purpose of explanation and corroboration.
The graphic expression of data and of details in a Survey report
is intended to aid the reader in comprehending the report, and this
is the prime advantage of its use, but it also enables the writer
to omit from his text numerous descriptive details. It would generally
be difficult without illustrations to present a clear picture of
the geology of a region in its exact relations, and especially to describe
adequately the form and the details of the structure of many
fossils. The tasks of both the writer and the reader of reports on
geology and kindred subjects are thus greatly facilitated by geologic
maps, sections, paleontologic drawings, and illustrations of other
kinds.</p>

<p>The responsibility for good and effective illustrations rests largely
upon the author, who should select and plan his illustrations with
a view to their utility in aiding the reader to understand his
report.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="SELECTION_AND_APPROVAL" id="SELECTION_AND_APPROVAL"></a>
SELECTION AND APPROVAL OF ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>


<p>There is no rule limiting the number of illustrations that may be
used in a publication of the Geological Survey, but in selecting illustrations
for a report an author may easily fall into the error of over-illustration.
The number of diagrammatic drawings or of drawings
that express the author's deductions is rarely in excess of the needs
of a paper, but the number of photographs submitted is often excessive.
The number of pages in a manuscript may be a factor in
determining the proper number of illustrations, but as the need of
illustrations varies greatly from paper to paper this factor alone is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
not decisive. The tendency to overillustrate led the Director to issue
the following order<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> governing the approval of illustrations:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> From Survey Order 63, Oct. 20, 1915.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The primary responsibility for the selection of illustrative material shall rest
upon the author and the chief of the branch transmitting the report: No one
knows the subject matter of the report better than its author, though a
sympathetic critic is usually needed to correct the personal equation that may
express itself In an excessive number of illustrations or the use of photographs
into which no one but the field man himself can read what he wishes to illustrate.
The approval by the chief of branch of the illustrations selected by the
author will be taken as vouching for those illustrations as essential and adequate,
and the scientific value of the illustrations will not be subject to review
in the section of illustrations.</p>

<p>The chief of the section of illustrations shall decide the technical questions
relating to the preparation of these illustrations for reproduction and may
recommend the rejection of any that do not promise effective or economical
reproduction. In the consideration of such questions, especially any relating
to maps, the cooperation of the editor of geologic maps and chief engraver will
be expected.</p></div>

<p>The judgment of an author as to the illustrative value of a photograph
is likely to be biased by his knowledge of the features that are
actually included in the view represented, not all of which may be
shown clearly in the photograph; his knowledge of all the features
enables him to see more in his picture than his readers will be able
to recognize without detailed description. Photographs in which
special or significant features are obscured by foliage or lost in hazy
distance do not make acceptable illustrations, and the use of a
picture that requires much description to make it illustrate reverses,
in a measure, the relations of text and illustrations.</p>

<p>A photograph is not necessarily good for reproduction simply because
it shows some particular feature to be illustrated; the quality
of the print it will afford when reproduced from an engraved plate
should also be considered. Some loss of detail by reproduction must
be expected, and therefore only the clearest and most effective prints
obtainable should be submitted.</p>

<p>If an author has difficulty in making his preliminary or "original"
drawings he may request that a draftsman be detailed to aid him.
The request should be made to the Director through the chief of
branch and properly approved. The work will then be done in the
section of illustrations as advance preparation, but finished drawings
should not be thus prepared unless the conditions are unusual. The
administrative geologist reviews all illustrations submitted and represents
the Director in matters relating to illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<p class="caption2">SUBMITTAL OF ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>


<p>All material intended for illustrations, except paleontologic specimens,
should be submitted with the manuscript of the paper to be
illustrated but in a separate package marked "Illustrations to accompany
a paper on &mdash;&mdash; by &mdash;&mdash;." The package should contain a
carbon copy of the list of illustrations that accompanies the manuscript
or, if the titles to be printed on or with the illustrations include
fuller descriptions than are given in that list, a carbon copy of
the list giving complete titles and descriptions, the original of which
should also accompany the manuscript. In the list each plate
and figure should be separately numbered consecutively in the order
in which it should appear in the report, and a figure opposite each
title should show the number of the manuscript page on which the
illustration is first mentioned or most fully discussed. Roman numerals
should be used for the plates and arabic numerals for the figures.
Each drawing or photograph should bear, in addition to the
number and title, any suggestions concerning preparation, reduction,
and method of reproduction which the author may consider especially
desirable. The list should be headed "Illustrations."</p>

<p>Specimens other than fossils that are to be illustrated must be submitted
directly to the section of illustrations, but the author may
first obtain photographic prints of them in order to make up his plates.
The specimens should be carefully packed and any that are fragile
should be so marked.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="KINDS_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS" id="KINDS_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS"></a>KINDS OF ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>


<p>The illustrations in reports of the Geological Survey may be classified
into five more or less distinct groups&mdash;(1) maps, (2) diagrams
(including graphs, sections, plans, figures of apparatus, and stereograms),
(3) outdoor photographs, (4) photographs and drawings of
specimens, and (5) sketches. These may be further divided into two
large groups, which may be called permanent and ephemeral. The
permanent group includes illustrations that do not lose value through
lapse of time or by natural alteration, such as detailed geologic maps,
well-prepared structure sections, views of specimens, and good photographs
or drawings of natural phenomena; the ephemeral group includes
maps showing progress, key maps, diagrams showing yearly
production, and many others that should be prepared in such a way
as to minimize cost of preparation and reproduction.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The illustrations will be finally divided into plates and figures
when they are fully prepared, but if an author desires to determine
the classification in advance of transmittal he should submit his
material to the section of illustrations, where methods, processes, and
reductions will be decided for each. In determining which shall be
plates and which shall be figures, size and method of reproduction are
the only factors to be considered; there are no other real differences.
Illustrations that require separate or special printing, such as those
reproduced by Lithography and by the photogravure, photogelatin,
and three-color processes, must be printed separately from the text as
plates and inserted in the report at the proper places; those that are
reproduced by relief processes, such as zinc and copper etching and
wax engraving, if not too large, can be printed with the text as
figures. If an illustration to be reproduced by a relief process is
marked for reduction to a size not exceeding that of the page of the
text, it can be called a figure and be printed with the text. Half
tones, though etched in relief, are rarely made text figures in Survey
reports, because to give satisfactory impressions they must be printed
on the best quality of coated paper, which is not used for the text.
By using the coarser screens shown in <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI</a>
(<a href="#Plate_VI">p. 56</a>), however, a
half-tone cut may be made that can be used in the text if it is smaller
than the page.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="SIZES_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS" id="SIZES_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS"></a>SIZES OF ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>


<p>The regular book publications of the Geological Survey are issued
in three sizes&mdash;(1) octavo (annual reports of the Director, statistical
reports on mineral resources, bulletins, and water-supply papers);
(2) quarto (professional papers and monographs); (3) folio (geologic
folios). The following table gives the measure of the text of
each size and the measure of the trimmed page, in inches:</p>

<p>Most professional papers are printed in two columns of type, each
3 inches wide, and folios are printed in three columns, each 4<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches
wide. A text figure in one of these publications can be made to fit one
or more columns, and it may run the full length of the text page.</p>

<p>The limits of the dimensions of plates and figures, in inches, are
given in the following table. If for any reason a plate can not be
reduced to the dimensions of a page it can be folded once or more;
and if it is large and unwieldy it may be placed in a pocket on the
inside of the back cover. (See <a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I</a>.)</p>

<p>For an octavo report a single-page plate with side title should be
4 inches or less in width, and a plate with bottom title should be 7
inches or less in depth. In other words, the actual depth and width
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of a single-page plate in a page of any size must depend on the number
of lines in its title, the inclusion of which should not extend
the matter much, if any, beyond the dimensions given in the table.
A difference of 1 inch or less in the width of a folding plate may
determine whether it must be folded once or twice, so that by consulting
this table an author may save expense in binding and promote
the reader's convenience in handling the plate.</p>

<p>A text figure (including the title) can not extend beyond the text
measure but may be of any size or shape within that measure, as
shown on <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, figures 4, 8, 9, 10.</p>




<p class="caption2">SUBDIVISIONS OF PLATES AND FIGURES.</p>


<p>If a plate consists of two or more parts or photographs each part
should be marked with an italic capital letter&mdash;<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, etc.&mdash;which
should be placed directly under each. If it is made up of many parts,
in the form of plates that accompany reports on paleontology, each
part should be similarly marked with an arable numeral&mdash;1, 2, 3, etc.
If a text figure is subdivided into two or more parts, each part should
be marked with a roman capital&mdash;A, B, C, etc.; and if details of a
part are to be described each detail should be marked by an italic
lower-case letter&mdash;a, 6, c, etc.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="PREPARATION_OF_COPY_BY_AUTHORS" id="PREPARATION_OF_COPY_BY_AUTHORS"></a>PREPARATION OF COPY BY AUTHORS.</p>


<p class="caption3">CHARACTER OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL.</p>

<p>In the Geological Survey, as elsewhere, the "originals"&mdash;that is,
the original material submitted by authors for the illustration of
their reports&mdash;differ greatly in character and in degree of clearness.
Some are carefully prepared; others are rough, obscure in part, and
defective in detail. Drawings made from poor originals progress
slowly, because the draftsman spends much time in interpreting uncertain
features or in conference with the author concerning details.
An original should be perfectly clear in detail and meaning, so that
the draftsman can follow it without doubt. It should not consist of
parts that must be brought together to make a new drawing, because
the result of the combination of the parts will be uncertain at the
outset and may not prove satisfactory. Each original illustration
should be prepared with the idea that the draftsman who will make
the finished drawing will be unfamiliar with the subject and will need
definite instructions; all data should be plotted and each figure or
plate should be completely made up before it is submitted. More or
less roughly prepared originals are expected, but they should show no
uncertainty in details. Obscure features may be cleared up by inclosing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the features in penciled loops connected by a line with notes
written on the margin, such as "omit this line," "turn at an angle
of 30&deg; from true north," "add," "cut out."</p>


<p class="caption3">PRELIMINARY PREPARATION OF MAPS.</p>

<p>The base map that generally accompanies a report may be an
original field sheet or it may have been compiled from various sources
by an author and made to incorporate the results of his field work.
It should not be a collection of maps of different scales and standards
to be worked into a new map.</p>

<p>The source of the data shown on every original base map should
be indicated on the map, whether it is to be used as an illustration
or as a record of field work. This information is required as a permanent
record for showing the reliability of the map, for use in comparing
data, and for giving full credit to those who are responsible
for the data. An author should see that this requirement is observed
in order that proper credit may be given and should especially see
that all cooperative agreements and organizations are properly mentioned.</p>

<p>An original map should preferably be complete in itself. It should
not consist of several parts or sheets unless the data to be represented
are unusually complex. All elaborate or technical finish of border
lines, lettering, or like features should be left to the draftsman or the
engraver.</p>

<p>Base maps that involve the compilation of new data should be
prepared by either the topographic branch or the division of Alaskan
mineral resources. If a base map already published is to be reused
it should be submitted to the chief topographic engineer or to the
chief of the division of Alaskan mineral resources for approval.
This procedure will insure a single standard of geographic accuracy
in maps appearing in Survey publications.</p>

<p>A geologist who requires a base map that includes new topographic
data should address a request for its preparation to the chief geologist,
who, through the Director, will refer the request to the topographic
branch. The request must be accompanied by a full statement
regarding the proposed report and the time when it is likely to
be submitted. The preparation of such base maps by draftsmen in
the division of geology, the land-classification board, the water-resources
branch, or the section of illustrations has been discontinued
except for the minor adaptations provided for above.</p>

<p>If a report requires the preparation of a base map that includes no
new topographic data such a map must be compiled from other authentic
maps by the division or branch in which the report originates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
If, however, no draftsmen are available in that division or branch, an
arrangement can be made with any other branch&mdash;as the topographic
or publication branch&mdash;that may have draftsmen available, with the
understanding that the cost of the work shall be reimbursed to the
branch doing the work by the branch ordering it. For indicating
geologic and other data, however, an author may make use of an
authentic base map already published, and after it is reduced or
enlarged to appropriate scale by photography such a map may suffice
for transmittal with a manuscript.</p>


<p class="caption3">MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR BASE MAPS.</p>

<p>The maps already published by the Geological Survey<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and other
Government bureaus should always be consulted when a new base is
to be compiled. The following list includes most of the maps available:</p>

<p>1. The Survey's regular topographic atlas sheets, published on three
scales&mdash;15-minute sheets, scale, 1:62,500; 30-minute sheets, scale,
1:125,000; 60-minute sheets, scale, 1:250,000&mdash;approximately 1 mile,
2 miles, and 4 miles to 1 inch, respectively&mdash;and its "special" maps,<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
some of which are published on other scales. All these maps can be
used as bases for detailed geologic maps, for compiling maps on
smaller scales, and for revising other maps.</p>

<p>2. The United States part of the international map of the world,
now being published on the scale of 1:1,000,000 (approximately 16
miles to 1 inch). Each sheet of this map represents an area measuring
6&deg; of longitude and 4&deg; of latitude. The published sheets of this map
may be used as bases for general maps. The sheets are drawn on the
scale of 1:500,000, and photolithographs on this scale are available
for use as bases for geologic or other maps.</p>

<p>The adaptability of the 1:1,000,000 scale map to use as a base for
general geologic maps is shown in the geologic maps of the southern
peninsula of Michigan and of Indiana in Monograph 53 (Pls. IV and
VII), the map of Florida in Bulletin 60 (Pl. I), and the map of
Vermont in Water-Supply Paper 424 (Pl. I).</p>

<p>3. The Survey's two-sheet wall map of the United States, 49 by 76
inches, scale 1:2,500,000 (approximately 40 miles to 1 inch). Parts
of this map can be used as bases for general geologic or other maps
and as copy for index and other small diagrammatic maps. This map
is published both with and without contours.</p>

<p>4. Land Office maps and township plats. These maps are now
being published on a scale of 12 miles to 1 inch; they are also photo-lithographed
on one-half that scale, or 24 miles to 1 inch. The township
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
plats are printed on a scale of one-half mile to 1 inch. The maps
are especially useful in compiling maps in which land lines (townships
and sections) are essential, and the township plats afford valuable detail
and are useful in field work and in revising other maps. Township
and section lines should appear on all land-classification maps
published by the Survey. On maps on a scale less than 1:250,000 only
the townships should be shown; on maps on scales greater than
1:250,000 the sections should be shown; on maps on a scale of
1:250,000 the sections should be shown, unless their representation
will materially impair the legibility of the map, in which case only
the townships should be shown. (See <a href="#Figure_1">fig. 1</a>.)</p>

<p>5. Post-route maps, covering single States or groups of adjacent
States, published on sheets of different sizes and on scales determined
mainly by the size of the State. The map of Texas is published
on a scale of 12 miles to 1 inch, that of Virginia on a scale
of 7 miles to 1 inch, and that of West Virginia on a scale of 6 miles to
1 inch. Both the Land Office and the post-route maps are useful for
reference in compiling maps on smaller scales. Post-route maps are
especially useful for comparing and verifying the location of cities,
towns, and railroads.</p>

<p>6. Coast and Geodetic Survey charts, published on scales that are
governed by the area represented and the amount of detail to be
shown. These maps should always be used in compiling and correcting
coast lines.</p>

<p>7. Maps and charts published by the Corps of Engineers of the
Army, the Mississippi River Commission, the surveys of the Great
Lakes, and the boundary surveys. These maps are especially useful
if the scale of the map to be compiled requires considerable detail.</p>

<p>8. The Survey's three small base maps of the United States&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
a map 18 by 28 inches, scale 110 miles to 1 inch, which is published
both with and without contours, or with relief or hypsometric shading;
(<i>b</i>) a map 11 by 16 inches, scale 190 miles to 1 inch; (<i>c</i>) a map
7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> by 12 inches, scale 260 miles to 1 inch, designed for use as a two-page
illustration in a bulletin or a water-supply paper.</p>

<p>9. The Century, Rand McNally &amp; Co.'s, Cram's, Stieler's, The
Times, Johnston's Royal, and county atlases.</p>

<p>10. State and county maps.</p>

<p>11. Railroad surveys, which are useful in furnishing data for elevations
as well as for locations of towns and stations.</p>

<p>12. The latest national-forest maps and proclamations. It is,
however, not necessary that national forests, bird reservations, and
national monuments be shown on a map in a report unless their
addition is specially requested by the author or by the chief of the
branch submitting the report, and they should not be shown if they
will obscure other more important data.</p>

<p>The Survey has published numerous maps of parts of Alaska,
as well as other maps, which are available for use or reuse in its reports.
Copies of all base maps for which copper plates have been
engraved by the Survey can be obtained on requisition, and their use
in a new report will save time as well as the cost of engraving. Other
maps will be found in the Survey library, where the latest editions
only should be consulted.</p>


<p class="caption3">BASIC FEATURES OF MAPS.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that "every map, whatever its scale, is a
reduction from nature and consequently must be more or less generalized."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The degree of generalization in the geologic and other
detail to be shown on a map usually involves a corresponding degree
of generalization in its base. Absolutely true generalization means
the same degree of omission of detail for each kind of feature. If a
base map on a scale of 1 mile to 1 inch, prepared with the usual
detail, were placed before a camera and reduced to a scale of 16 miles
to 1 inch, the lines representing the smaller tributaries of streams and
the smaller water bodies, as well as many other features, would probably
be so greatly reduced in length as to be illegible. If from this
reduced photograph a new map were prepared, from which all
features not plainly discernible were omitted, the new map should
represent what might be called true generalization. This degree of
generalization is, however, not practicable, but unessential detail
should be systematically omitted. The amount of detail which a base
map should show is limited by its scale, by the character of the country
it represents, and by the kind of data to be shown. Coordinate
features of a topographic map should be shown with equal detail.
Detail in culture may call for detail in drainage, though relief may
be greatly generalized or entirely omitted; detail in relief may like-wise
call for detail in drainage, though culture may be more generalized.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Gannett,
Henry, A manual of topographic methods: U. S. Geol. Survey Mon. 22, p.
107, 1893.</p></div>

<p>If the three fundamental features of a topographic map&mdash;the culture,
the drainage, and the relief&mdash;are to be engraved or photo-lithographed
separately and printed in colors, the best results can be
obtained by drawing each feature in a separate color on one sheet unless
the work is coarse and great precision in register is not needed. The
culture should be drawn in black waterproof ink, the drainage in
Prussian blue, and the relief in burnt sienna; but care should be
taken that the colors used will photograph well. To insure a good
photograph it is usually necessary to add a little black to the blue and
brown. (See "<a href="#INKS">Inks</a>," <a href="#INKS">p. 25</a>.) The photographer will then make three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
negatives and will opaque or paint out all but one of the three features
on each negative. The cost is somewhat greater than that of reproducing
three separate drawings, but the result gives more accurate
register than if the drawings were made on separate sheets, which
are likely to change in size before they are reproduced.</p>


<p class="caption3">STANDARD SCALES.</p>

<p>The standard scales of the maps used in the publications of the
Geological Survey are fractions or multiples of 1:1,000,000 (see
p. 14), except for a map that is reduced expressly to fit one or two
pages of a report or that is reduced horizontally or vertically to fit
the text as a small diagrammatic or index map. It should be remembered
that a map which may be serviceable for use in compiling
a new map, except as to scale, can be reduced or enlarged to the
scale of the new drawing by photography, by a pantograph, or by
other means. (See <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>.)</p>

<p>Maps compiled by an author should be prepared on a scale of at
least 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> times and preferably twice the size of the scale used on the
published map. Maps traced on linen should be no less than twice
the size of publication. Not only is the quality of the reproduction
improved by considerable reduction, but the larger scale of the
drawing facilitates the plotting of details. It should be remembered,
however, that a linear reduction of one-half produces a map only
one-fourth the area of the original, and reduction so great may
prevent the addition of data, such as an extended note in small letters
applying to a small area on the face of a map, which would not be
legible when reduced.</p>


<p class="caption3">ORIENTATION OF MAPS.</p>

<p>A map that bears no arrow indicating north is supposed to be
oriented north and south, and its title should read from west to east.
If, however, the area mapped has a general trend in one direction,
as northwest to southeast, and its squaring up by a north-south line
would leave too much blank paper, this general rule is not followed.
The border lines on such a map should conform to the general trend
of the area mapped, an arrow should show north, and the title and
scale should be placed horizontally, but the projection numbers and
town names should follow the direction of the parallels of latitude.
(See Pls. X and XII, Bull. 628; and Pls. VI, XV, and XVI,
Mon. 52.)</p>


<p class="caption3">PROJECTION.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> See also pp. 43-45, where the method of projecting a map is more fully explained.</p></div>

<p>The polyconic projection has been adopted by the Geological Survey
for its topographic atlas sheets and must be consistently used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for its other maps. If a new map is to be compiled an accurate
projection should first be constructed, and no plotting should be done
on it until the projection has been checked and found to be correct.
A projection should be checked or proved by some one other than
the person who prepared it. Next the drainage and the water areas
should be outlined; then the cultural features should be added; and
finally the relief, whether expressed by contour lines, hachures, or
shading.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> See pp. 49-48 for methods of tracing and transferring.</p></div>


<p class="caption3">EXPLANATION.</p>

<p>Under the heading "Explanation" should be placed all matter
needed to describe fully the details of an illustration, whether map,
diagram, or section, so that if the illustration became detached it
would be a complete self-explanatory unit.</p>

<p>The explanation of a map may be placed inside the border lines
if there is ample room for it, or it may be placed outside. The standard
arrangement for an outside explanation for geologic maps is
shown, in the geologic folios, which should be followed in general
form. If there is space within the border lines the explanation may
be appropriately arranged therein, either in a vertical column or
horizontally, according to the size and shape of the space available.
If the sequence of formation is shown by horizontal arrangement the
younger formations are placed at the left and the older at the right.
If it is shown by a vertical arrangement the youngest formation is
placed at the top.</p>

<p>Each original map submitted by an author should have at least
4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches of blank margin on the right and at the bottom in which
to place the explanation, scale, title, and other matter, but the author
should make no attempt to elaborate these features nor should he
employ a draftsman to letter them carefully. Plainly written ordinary
script is quits sufficient for original maps; the final lettering,
which may consist entirely of impressions from type, will be added
after submittal of a report.</p>


<p class="caption3">TITLES OF MAPS AND OTHER ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>

<p>The titles of maps should be supplied by authors but are subject
to revision in order to make them agree with established forms.
They should be written in ordinary script, not carefully lettered.
They should state concisely the kind of map, the area shown, the
special features represented, and the county, State, or Territory in
which the area is located. (See <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>.) Titles are reproduced directly
only on lithographs, three-color prints, photogelatin plates, and
other illustrations that are printed by contractors, not by the Government
Printing Office. The titles of illustrations that are repro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>duced
by relief processes, such as zinc etching, half tone, and wax
engraving, are printed at the Government Printing Office from
type, and proofs are submitted to the authors for examination.</p>


<p class="caption3">SYMBOLS USED ON MAPS.</p>

<p class="caption4">GENERAL FEATURES.</p>

<p>More than 200 symbols have been used on maps to express 25 different
kinds of data, a fact indicating at once a notable lack of uniformity
and a need of standardization. It is of course impossible to
provide a characteristic symbol that can be used uniformly for each
kind of feature, and therefore the same symbol may be used on different
maps to express different things. The symbols shown in
<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a> are those most used on geologic maps. The symbols for
dip and strike, fault lines, mine shafts, prospects, and several others
are generally well known, but on some maps it may be necessary to
modify a standard symbol to express additional distinctions. The
symbols shown, however, will cover all the ordinary requirements of
miscellaneous mapping. Though the plate shows more than one
symbol for some features the symbol most commonly used is given first
and should be preferred. The center of each symbol should mark
the location of the feature symbolized. Symbols are not always
platted with sufficient care. On small-scale maps they are difficult
to locate and unless great care is taken in platting them they are
likely to be several miles out of place. All symbols should be located
precisely where they belong.</p>

<p>The symbol showing dip and strike should be accurately platted
by means of a protractor, so that the strike will be shown graphically,
without a number and a degree mark, and not need replatting
by a draftsman or engraver. The dip, however, should be indicated
by a number and a degree mark.</p>

<p class="caption4">LETTER SYMBOLS.</p>

<p>The letter symbols used on most geologic maps to indicate the
ages and names of the formations represented consist of two or more
letters&mdash;an initial capital letter for the name of the system and one
or more lower-case letters for the name of the formation or of the
material, as Qt (Quaternary&mdash;lower terrace deposits); Cpv (Carboniferous&mdash;Pottsville
formation); COk (Cambrian-Ordovician&mdash;Knox
dolomite), etc. The standard usage for this feature is shown
in the geologic folios but is subject to modification in other publications.</p>

<p>In preparing an original geologic map a letter symbol, such as has
been just described, or a number should be put in the proper place
in the explanation, and the same symbol or number should be repeated
at one or more places on the map within the areas to which it refers.
Each area that is indicated by a color should be marked with the
proper symbol in order to make its identification sure, for light colors
especially are likely to fade and mixed colors can not be discriminated
with certainty.</p>

<p class="caption4">OIL AND GAS SYMBOLS.</p>

<p>A complete set of symbols for maps showing oil and gas is given
on <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>. Referring to these symbols the chief geologist, in a
memorandum to the Director, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The symbols used by the Survey in its oil and gas maps have not been in
accord with those used by the oil companies, nor have they been wholly logical.
It appears that though they were submitted for recommendation they never
have been formally approved.</p>

<p>Herewith I submit a code prepared by the geologists of the oil and gas
section. They conform largely to commercial use and embrace its best features
as well as the best and most logical features of our previous usage, the departures
from which are, after all, of minor consequence.</p>

<p>The symbols here submitted [see <a href="#Plate_II">PI. II</a>] with recommendation for approval
are founded on a building-up system, so that the history and the results of drilling
at any location can be recorded by slight additions to symbol and without
erasure. Thus maps may be revised without scratching.</p>

<p>In drawing these symbols the draftsman should make the rays of the gas
well distinct and in adding the vertical bar or line showing that a hole is
dry or abandoned should make it long enough to be distinct. It would be preferable
to draw this bar obliquely, but an oblique position would coincide with
some of the patterns on certain maps, and it should therefore be placed vertically.
The vertical line indicates the failure or abandonment of the well,
the symbol for which Is thus scratched off or canceled by the line drawn through
it. The symbols agree so far with commercial usage that oil men will have
little need to consult the explanation.</p>
</div>

<p class="caption4">SYMBOLS FOR USE ON MAPS SHOWING FEATURES OF GROUND WATER.</p>

<p>The symbols used on maps relating to ground water represent the
features named below, each of which has been shown in publications
already issued.</p>

<table style="width:35em;" summary="Map Symbols">
<tr>
  <td>Area of absorption or outcrop.<br />
  Depth to water table.<br />
  Contours of water table.<br />
  Fluctuation of water table.<br />
  Depth to water-bearing formation.<br />
  Structure contours of water-bearing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formation.<br />
  Area of artesian flow.<br />
  Head of artesian water.</td>
  <td class="vtop">Area that discharges ground water.<br />
  Quality of ground water.<br />
  Area irrigated with ground water.<br />
  Nonflowing well.<br />
  Flowing well.<br />
  Unsuccessful or dry well.<br />
  Well with pumping plant.<br />
  Spring.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The lack of uniformity in the symbols commonly employed to represent
these features is due to differences in the number of color
on the maps and differences in the scale. Standard colors for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
larger features, such as those for areas of artesian flow, areas of absorption,
and curves showing depths to water table or to water-bearing
formations, can not be fixed, because of considerations of economy in
printing. For example, if light green is the standard color to be used
for delineating areas irrigated by ground water and no green is used
on other parts of the map its use would represent an additional or
special printing, whereas a tint of blue, brown, or purple, if any of
these colors is used for other features on the map, might be used
also for this feature without additional printing. Therefore the
general use of any particular color for a water feature seems to
be impracticable; but this fact should not preclude the adoption of
color standards for use subject to the requirements of economy in publication.</p>

<p>The ordinary symbols for wells are the open circle and the solid
circle, or dot. Only in the secondary or specific well symbols does
there appear to be lack of uniformity, the choice of secondary symbols
being governed either by personal preference or by the requirements
for specific distinction.</p>

<p>All symbols should, if possible, suggest the things they represent.
Wells are circular and hence the open circle is most used and most
appropriate for nonflowing wells. To indicate a flowing well the
circle is made solid, denoting that the well is full of water. For an
unsuccessful well the most suggestive symbol would be an open circle
with a line drawn through it to denote cancellation. It has been
suggested that if water features, including wells, are to be printed in
blue, unsuccessful wells, or dry holes, be printed in black. A large
circle drawn around the symbol for a flowing or nonflowing well will
appropriately denote a pumping plant at the well.</p>

<p>The accepted symbol for a spring is a dot with a waved tail representing
the direction of flow, if known. This symbol can not be
modified without destroying its prime characteristics, but it may be
accompanied by a letter indicating the kind of spring. An open
circle with a tail might be used on large-scale maps, but it would be
out of scale on other maps, whereas the black or blue dot and tail will
fit maps of any scale.</p>

<p>The following colors and symbols can most appropriately be used
to represent ground-water features. The well and spring symbols
can be varied by adding letters if they are necessary to express other
data than those indicated in the list below.</p>

<p class="caption3"><i>General ground-water features.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Area of absorption or outcrop: Flat color used on the map to show the geologic

<p class="caption3">BLACK-LINE CONVENTIONS.</p>

<p>A complete set of the black-line patterns used to distinguish areas
on a map is given in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII</a> (<a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>), and their application to
a finished drawing is shown in <a href="#Figure_9">figure 9</a> (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>). These patterns,
however, should preferably not be used by the author in his preliminary
work on an illustration. For this purpose water colors or
colored crayons are preferable, and the distinctions between areas
may be emphasized by letter symbols.</p>


<p class="caption3">MATERIALS USED IN PREPARING MAPS.</p>

<p class="caption4">PAPER.</p>

<p>For large and important maps which may at some time be extended
to cover a greater area or which may be made to fit maps
already prepared or published the paper used should be mounted on
muslin to reduce to a minimum the shrinking or stretching caused by
atmospheric changes. Pure white paper produces a better negative
than a cream or yellowish paper and will retain its color longer, but
all papers become more yellow with age and exposure to light.</p>

<p>The following brands of paper are used in the Survey in the
preparation of maps:</p>

<p>"Normal" K. &amp; E., unmounted. Has an excellent surface and
comes in flat sheets, 19 by 24, 22 by 30, and 27 by 40 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Paragon" K. &amp; E., mounted on muslin. In 10-yard rolls 72
inches wide. Used in the Survey for large office drawings and maps
of large scale.</p>

<p>"Anvil" K. &amp; E., mounted on muslin. In 10-yard rolls 42, 62,
and 72 inches wide. Used in the Survey for large drawings.</p>

<p>"Whatman's hot pressed," unmounted or mounted on muslin. In
sheets ranging in size from 13 by 17 to 31 by 53 inches. An excellent
paper for maps. The muslin-backed paper is recommended for use
in preparing large detailed maps and base maps that are to be
retained as permanent records. The muslin provides a durable and
flexible backing that permits the map to be rolled, and paper thus
mounted is particularly serviceable for a map which may be subjected
to considerable revision and to which must be added finally
a title, explanation, and other marginal matter.</p>

<p>"Ross's relief hand-stipple drawing paper." A stiff enameled or
chalk-coated paper whose surface has been compressed into minute
points that stand in slight relief so that a shade made on it with
pencil or crayon is broken up into dots and can be reproduced by
photo-engraving. For use in making shaded drawings, drawings
showing relief by light and shade, etc. Similar paper is prepared
for parallel-line and other pattern effects. In sheets ranging in size
from 11 by 14 to 22 by 28 inches. (See <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a> for method of using.)</p>

<p>Profile and cross-section paper. In sheets of convenient sizes or
in rolls. Bears lines printed in blue, green, red, or orange, in many
kinds of rulings, which may be selected by reference to catalogues.
Profile and cross-section paper printed in orange is recommended for
preliminary drawings; blue is recommended for drawings that are
made in pencil and submitted for inking in.</p>

<p class="caption4">BRISTOL BOARD.</p>

<p>For the smaller maps, such as key maps and maps less than 18 by 24
inches, and for small drawings made for direct reproduction, Reynolds's
bristol board is recommended on account of its pure-white color
and its hardness, which permits erasures to be made without affecting
redrawing over the corrected area. It is obtained in 2-ply, 3-ply,
and 4-ply sheets. The 2-ply and 3-ply are especially useful in making
delicate brush and pencil drawings and pen and ink drawings.
The sizes used in the Survey are 16<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> by 20<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, 18<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> by 22<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, and
21<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> by 28<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches.</p>

<p class="caption4">TRACING LINEN.</p>

<p>Tracing cloth or linen is especially useful for large work that will
require considerable reduction. (See <a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>.) Its advantages are that
a tracing that has been carefully made on it over any kind of copy for
direct reproduction by a photo-engraving process can be used for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
making a paper negative for contact printing or blue printing. On
the other hand, it is susceptible to atmospheric changes that affect
scale, and the lines traced on it are not reproduced as sharply as those
made on paper. It can be obtained in rolls 30 to 54 inches wide.</p>

<p>Erasures should be made on tracing linen with a hard rubber
eraser, not with a sand rubber or a steel eraser.</p>

<p class="caption4"><a name="INKS" id="INKS"></a>INKS.</p>

<p>The best drawing inks are in liquid form, ready for use. They
should be waterproof and equal to the grade known as Higgins's
waterproof ink. When a suitable waterproof blue ink can not be
obtained, a good blue for features of drainage can be made by dissolving
a half pan of Winsor &amp; Newton's prussian blue in water. No
good waterproof burnt sienna ink seems to be obtainable, but a good
substitute can be made by dissolving Winsor &amp; Newton's water color
of that name.</p>

<p>Ink lines should be drawn in full strength of color&mdash;lines that
should be black must not appear grayish, for example&mdash;and pens
should be kept clean. The same pen should not be used for applying
two inks, as the mixture thus produced is likely to thicken or coagulate
on the pen. A little black should be added to colored inks that are
used in making drawings to be reproduced in colors in order to
strengthen the lines for photographic reproduction.</p>

<p class="caption4">DRAWING PENS.</p>

<p>The pens made by Keuffel &amp; Esser, especially their No. 3202, and
Gillott's Nos. 291, 290, 170, and 303 give complete satisfaction. The
Gillott numbers are given in the order of fineness of the points. No.
291 being the finest. The best cleaner for a drawing pen is a piece
of chamois skin.</p>

<p class="caption4">PENCILS.</p>

<p>Pencils used for drawing should have leads of a quality equal to
those of the Koh-i-noor brand, in which the grades of hardness are
indicated by 3B, 2B, B, HB, F, H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H,
and 9H; the softest grade is 3B and the hardest 9H. The grades most
generally used are B, HB, F, 4H, and 6H.</p>

<p class="caption4">RUBBER ERASERS AND CLEANERS.</p>

<p>Two kinds of rubber erasers are usually employed in making
erasures on drawings&mdash;a hard, dense rubber like the "Ruby," and a
soft, pliable rubber like the "Venus" or "H" (Hardtmuth). The
soft rubber is also useful for cleaning large surfaces. Art gum is
also recommended for this purpose and has the advantage of not
disturbing the surface of the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption4">COLORED PENCILS AND CRAYONS.</p>

<p>Colored pencils and crayons are useful only for coloring preliminary
maps. They are not recommended for use on maps that
are to be kept for reference or to be submitted for reproduction, because
the colors rub off, but they can be used on photographic prints of
base maps or on transparent oversheets, for which the unglazed side
of tracing cloth is well suited. When they are so used register marks
should be added at numerous points on the map and the oversheet, including
the four comers, the color boundaries should be drawn or
traced, and finally the colors should be added. Two or more colors
should not be used on any one area to modify a tone, but each area
should be colored with a separate crayon. Patterns or designs should
not be used except to strengthen contrasts, and for that purpose a
pattern may be drawn with a black pencil over a color.</p>

<p class="caption4">WATER COLORS.</p>

<p>By dilution to half strength some of the standard water colors will
yield a tint or hue that will contrast with other tints or hues produced
in the same way quits as well as undiluted or full colors will
contrast with one another. The colors named below, except chrome-yellow
and emerald-green, are among those that when diluted will
afford satisfactory contrasts among themselves and with their full
colors and are recommended for use in coloring original maps.</p>

<table style="width:35em;" summary="Water colors">
<tr>
  <td>Mauve.<br />
  Crimson lake.<br />
  Orange-vermilion.<br />
  Burnt sienna.<br />
  Cadmium-yellow.<br />
  Chrome-yellow.<br />

  <td class="vtop">Hooker's green No. 2.<br />
  Emerald-green.<br />
  Payne's gray.<br />
  Lampblack.<br />
  Sepia.<br />
  Cerulean blue.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Other pigments spread better than cerulean blue and emerald-green,
but the exceptional purity of color of these two seems to warrant
their use.</p>

<p class="caption4">JAPANESE TRANSPARENT WATER COLORS.</p>

<p>Japanese transparent water colors, so called, are used by some
geologists. They spread evenly and are convenient for field use, but
they can not be washed out like other water colors, so that when they
are once applied to an area and a change of color becomes necessary
they must be bleached out. A good bleach is sodium hypochlorite,
which should be applied with a brush until the color disappears, and
the area dried with a blotter before recoloring. Light tints of these
colors are believed to be somewhat fugitive if exposed to strong light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3">COLORING GEOLOGIC MAPS.</p>

<p>The colors used on most original maps are not pleasing, a fact that
is of no particular importance, but&mdash;and this is of importance&mdash;they
often fail to give clear distinctions; the separate areas can not always
be identified or distinguished with certainty. Again, some colors are
fugitive, and when laid on in light tints they disappear entirely or
become uncertain. Much of the difficulty in identifying and discriminating
colors on an author's original maps is due to the promiscuous
mixing of colors. Many persons can not match or discriminate mixed
or broken colors. Hence if the supply of a color produced by mixing
becomes exhausted and the attempt is made to duplicate it by a
second mixture the two will probably fail to match. It is therefore
suggested that colors in full strength and colors diluted to half
strength be used instead of mixtures of two or more pigments, so
that one color in two strengths or tones can be employed to indicate
areas that are to be distinguished. The colors listed on <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a> will
give 24 satisfactory distinctions and will thus supply all demands for
map coloring.</p>

<p>To insure satisfactory contrasts between colored areas on a map,
unlike colors should be placed next to each other&mdash;that is, colors
should be placed together that are widely separated in the spectrum,
such as yellow and mauve, red and green, blue and orange, burnt
sienna and olive-green; not such as red and orange, blue and purple,
orange and yellow, sepia and burnt sienna.</p>

<p>A sufficient quantity of water and color pigment to be used for one
formation area on a map should be stirred in a saucer until the desired
tint is produced before it is applied. To maintain the same tone
properly the color should be well stirred every time the brush is
filled; if it is not stirred the brush will on the next dipping take up
a lighter tint, because most pigments, especially those derived from
minerals, tend to precipitate. When the colors are applied the map
should preferably be placed in a slightly inclined position, and the
coloring should be started at the upper boundaries of an area to be
colored, the well-filled brush being pulled toward the painter and
Worked rapidly back and forth horizontally, the edges of the fresh
color being kept wet. If the edges are allowed to dry, a hard line
and a smeared or uneven effect will be produced.</p>

<p>A strong color should generally be used for small areas unless the
map shows also large areas that must have the same color; lighter
hues should be used for large areas. Bright colors are best suited for
areas of igneous rocks, dikes, and veins, and these may be reduced in
strength for the larger areas.</p>

<p>The Survey's color scheme (see <a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>) need not be applied at this
stage of preparation, except in the most general way. Appropriate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
final colors can be best selected when the new map is made ready for
engraving. In the author's original maps adequate color distinctions
between areas are more important than the use of standard geologic
colors. Patterns should not be ruled in one color on an original map
to indicate distinctions between different formations of the same age
or period, because such patterns are difficult to produce by hand with
proper uniformity except by engraving.</p>

<p>It is of vital importance that an original base map should be free
from colors and from technical symbols in order that it may be kept
clean for photographing and preserved for possible future use. Such
a map should preferably be photographed in order to obtain prints
on which to add the colors and symbols; the use of an oversheet for
this purpose is not nearly so satisfactory. When photographed a base
map should be reduced to publication scale in order to save the additional
cost of a larger negative, and this reduced map may be made
up for publication by the addition of colors and symbols, title, explanation,
etc.; but the lithographer will also need the original base map
from which to make his reproduction.</p>


<p class="caption3">DIAGRAMS.</p>

<p class="caption4">ESSENTIAL FEATURES.</p>

<p>The term "diagrams," as used here, includes such illustrations as
mine plans, profiles, sections, stereograms, and maps that are more
diagrammatic than cartographic. The first essential in the original
drawings for simple diagrams is clearness of copy. Simplicity of
subject does not warrant hasty preparation, for an original sketch
that has been carelessly drawn and is inaccurate or inconsistent in
detail may lead to serious errors. Ruled paper printed especially for
platting profiles and cross sections should be used. Curves or graphs
made by an author with pencil on blue-lined section paper may be
inked by more skillful draftsmen. An author's pencil sketches are
usually satisfactory if they indicate plainly the facts to be represented,
but they should be prepared with some care as to detail. Tables and
like matter are not generally satisfactory material from which to prepare
drawings. In drawings for diagrams that are to be printed in the
text as figures the use of large, solid black bars or of conspicuous areas
of solid black is objectionable, because the black is likely to print
gray and to appear uneven in tone. Ruled tints or cross lining give
better effects. Stereograms should be prepared by an author with
especial care, for they represent facts only as the author sees them,
and the author's view must be imparted to the draftsman graphically.
The "third dimension"&mdash;the relief&mdash;in such drawings is not easily
expressed and should be brought out clearly in the author's rough
sketches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>For illustrations of apparatus photographs are preferred, but
if rough sketches are submitted they should show not only correct
relations but all dimensions.</p>

<p class="caption4">PLANS OF MINE WORKINGS.</p>

<p>Blue prints obtained from mining companies are acceptable for
plans of mines or underground workings, but all unnecessary or
irrelevant details on such plans must be canceled and all essential features
retained, and every essential feature, especially any added data,
must be clearly interpretable. Many such blue prints are so large and
unwieldy that they must be greatly reduced by photography before
they can be redrawn. If the lines are too weak to photograph, a tracing
of the essential parts can be made and reduced to about twice
publication size. The shadowless drafting table, described on pages 47-48,
is well adapted to the work of making such tracings. Blue
prints can also be pantographed to any convenient size if the details
are not too minute or complex.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 661px;">

<span class="caption">Figure 2.&mdash;Conventional lines used in preparing plans and diagrams of mine workings to
distinguish different levels.</span>
</div>

<p>The levels in plans of underground workings can be differentiated
in finished drawings by a system of conventional outlines in black,
as shown in <a href="#Figure_2">figure 2</a>, by conventional patterns or symbols within
plain outlines, or by colors. Such plans should not be printed in
colors unless the maze of workings is so complex that lines showing
the different levels would become confused or obscure if printed in
black.</p>

<p class="caption4">SECTIONS.</p>

<p>The standard forms of geologic sections are shown in the geologic
folios. Structure sections should be prepared with great care as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
detail but without attempt at refinement of lines and lettering. The
author's drawing of a section along a line or zone that is not definitely
indicated by a line on an accompanying map should be so prepared
that it may be copied exactly. On the other hand, the draftsman, in
reproducing a section that represents the structure along a given line
or zone, may be able to make the outcrops coincide with the topography
and the formation boundaries shown on the map, but the
structure, or the interpretation of it to be given, should be carefully
worked out by the author. All essential facts relating to bedding,
folding, faulting, crosscutting dikes and veins, or other significant
details should be indicated with precision. No attempt need be made
to draw firm, steady lines so long as the essential facts are clearly
expressed.</p>

<p>All sections should be drawn to scale, and both the vertical and the
horizontal scale should be given on the drawing. These scales should
be uniform if possible, or at least the vertical exaggeration should
be minimized. Too great vertical exaggeration creates distortion and
is grossly misleading. Sections should be drawn to scale on ruled
paper prepared for the use of authors. Such paper may be obtained
on requisition.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 734px;">

<span class="caption">Figure 3.&mdash;Section and perspective view showing relations of surface features to the
different kinds of rock and the structure of the beds.</span>
</div>

<p>A kind of cross section which is not often used but which gives a
more pictorial and clearer conception of underground relations than
other kinds is made by adding a sketch of the topography above the
section. This sketch should be a perspective view, in which the
prominent features shown hypothetically in the section below it
will be reflected in the topography. Such a sketch might show, for
example, not only monoclinal slopes, "hogbacks" due to steeply upturned
beds, terraces, escarpments, and like features, but volcanic
necks or other extruded masses in their true relations to the underground
geology of the country. (See fig, 3.) In submitting the
draft of such an illustration the author should, if possible, submit
also a sketch or photographs of the adjacent country and indicate on
the section the point of view by notes such as "Sketch A made at
this point," "See photograph B." The sketch will be more useful
if it is prepared on a scale consistent with the details of the section.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
It may be made with a pencil and should show as well as possible
the relations of the features in the landscape to those in the section.
Some good examples of illustrations of this type can be found in
Powell's "Exploration of the Colorado River," pages 182-193. One
simpler figure of the same kind is given on the cover of the geologic
folios.</p>

<p>In preparing original drawings representing columnar sections, or
sections in wells or ravines, the author should indicate all well-defined
or important local features of structure, such as cross-bedding, ore
bodies, or lenses. If there are no unusual features or details, the subdivisions
need be identified only by names of materials, such as "thin-bedded
limestone," or "slates with some coal," the coal beds being
shown. The sections should, however, be so plotted and subdivided by
the author that each section or group of sections will be complete in
its crude form. The compilation of various parts into one unit and
the construction of columnar sections by reference to tables alone is
an essential part of the author's original preparation.</p>

</div>

<p>Sections designed to show the relative thickness of beds of coal,
arranged in groups for publication either as plates or figures, should
be drawn in columns three or four tenths of an inch wide and reduced
one-half, as shown in <a href="#Figure_4">figure 4</a>. These sections, whether correlated
or not, should be drawn to some definite vertical scale and should
show the thickness of the coal beds, preferably by numbers indicating
feet and inches, the other material being symbolized and the symbols
explained graphically, as shown in <a href="#Figure_4">figure 4</a>. The vertical scale should
always be stated for the use of the draftsman. A bar scale may be
used instead of figures showing the dimensions of the individual beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3">LITHOLOGIC SYMBOLS.</p>

<p>The symbols used to indicate the various kinds of rocks illustrated
in sections and diagrams are shown in <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>. The units or elements
of these symbols may be spaced more openly in generalized
diagrammatic sections than in sections that show great detail.</p>

<p>Symbols should be used consistently throughout a report, and in
order to make them consistent a set showing the symbol to be used
for each kind of rock to be indicated should be prepared before the
original drawings are made. Some inconsistencies may be unavoidable
on account of the small size of some areas shown and the contrast
needed between others; but the deviations from the set of
symbols adopted should be minimized.</p>


<p class="caption3">USE OF PHOTOGRAPHS AS ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>

<p class="caption4">ESSENTIAL FEATURES.</p>

<p>The foundation of a good photographic print is a good negative,
and the best prints for reproduction as illustrations are those made
from negatives in which the illumination is evenly distributed and
the details are sharp&mdash;such negatives as are obtainable only by the
use of small stops and correct focusing. A good print should not
present too sharp contrasts between its dark and its light parts; if it
does, the printed reproduction will show a loss of detail in both.
Sufficiency of detail depends largely on focus, stopping down, and
timing; brilliancy is the direct result of ample illumination by sun or
artificial light, without which a photograph will be dull or "flat"
and generally unsatisfactory for reproduction. Bad weather may
prevent good field exposures, yet even in bad weather acceptable
negatives may be obtained by judicious focusing, stopping down,
and timing. If a negative is overexposed it may be full of detail,
but flat and too thin to print well. If underexposed it will show no
details in its lighter parts and the shadows will be black; and a
black shadow is nothing less than a blemish. Some detail should
appear in all shadows and in the middle tones, and some should
appear in the high lights; and a print in which these are evenly developed
and in which the illumination is distributed uniformly is
technically perfect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately not all field photographs are good, so an author
must select from his collection those which will make the best half
tones. In making this selection he should of course consider, first,
the scientific value of the photograph, and next, its pictorial or artistic
quality, which, though of secondary importance, should nevertheless
be kept in mind. A feature worthy of illustration deserves good pictorial
expression; if it is of superior scientific interest it should not
be represented by an inferior photograph. Fortunately, a good,
accurate drawing may be made from a poor photograph, and a photographic
view that has only minor defects can be successfully retouched.
Photographs that need much retouching should generally
be larger than publication size, for the effects of retouching&mdash;brush
marks, etc.&mdash;will be softened by reduction. Photographs that need
only slight retouching need not be larger than publication size. A
photograph can rarely be satisfactorily enlarged in reproduction
unless it is sharp in detail and requires no retouching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Unmounted prints are always preferable for use in making illustrations.
A group that is to form a single plate should be placed in an
envelope bearing the number of the plate and its title, and each print
of the group should bear a corresponding number, written in pencil
on its back. The envelope will protect the prints and keep them
together, and the numbers will identify them. Red ink should not be
used to mark photographs, as it is likely to penetrate the coating or
even the fiber of the paper, so that it can not be erased.</p>

<p>If a print is of doubtful quality two copies of it should be submitted&mdash;one
glazed, the other having a dead finish or "mat" surface,
which is generally preferable if the print must be considerably
retouched. The best prints for use as illustrations are those made on
"regular" or "special" semimat velox and glossy haloid papers. The
author should indicate prints that may be grouped together according
to their relation geographically or by subject. Generally two half
tones will be combined on a page, and the list of illustrations should
be prepared accordingly.</p>

<p>With slight trimming and reduction, three photographs measuring
3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> by 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches may be made up one above the other to form a full-page
octavo plate. Four photographs in which the longer dimensions
represent vertical distances may sometimes be used if they are
placed sidewise on the page, with side titles.</p>

<p>Some photographs may be reduced to the width of a page by
trimming instead of by photographic reduction, which may involve
loss of detail. The author should clearly indicate the extent of such
trimming as they may bear without loss of essential details. The
trimming is best done during the final preparation. A line should
not be drawn across a photograph to mark such trimming, but
the position of the line or lines should be indicated either on temporary
mounts, on the backs of the prints, or by a statement, such
as "One inch may be cut off on right, one-fourth inch on left, and
one-half inch at bottom."</p>

<p class="caption4">COPYRIGHTED PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>

<p>Section 4965 (ch. 3, title 60) of the Revised Statutes, amended by
act of March 2, 1895 (Stat. L., vol. 28, p. 965), provides that no
copyrighted photograph may be used without the consent of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
proprietor of the copyright in writing signed in the presence of
two witnesses. A penalty of $1 is imposed for every sheet on which
such a photograph is reproduced without consents, "either printing,
printed, copied, published, imported, or exposed for sale." An
author should therefore obtain the written consent of the owner of
a copyrighted photograph to use it, and the letter giving this consent
should be submitted with the illustration.</p>

<p class="caption4">SOURCES OF PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>

<p>Every photograph submitted with a manuscript should bear a
memorandum giving the name of the photographer or the owner of the
negative. If the negative is in the Survey's collection that fact
should be stated, as "Neg. Keith 318." The Survey receives many
requests for copies of photographs that have been reproduced as
illustrations in its publications, and replies to these requests will be
facilitated if the Survey's number or the source of each photograph
presented for use as an illustration is stated as above on the photograph.</p>

<p class="caption4">LENDING ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS.</p>

<p>A photograph that has been used in making a half-tone cut for a
Survey report can not be lent, but if the negative is on file a print
can be furnished at cost; and a Survey drawing that is well preserved
can be photographed and a print furnished, also at cost. Requests
for such prints should be addressed to the Director.</p>

<p class="caption4">UNPUBLISHED PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>

<p>The Survey can not issue a copy of an unpublished photograph
except upon the written approval or requisition of the person under
whose name the negative is filed. This requirement does not apply
to a print needed for official use, nor to a print made from an old
negative reserved under the name of any present member of the
Survey or from a negative that has been released by the person
under whose name it is filed.</p>

<p>Authors using Survey photographs in unofficial publications are
requested to acknowledge the source of the photograph by adding to
the printed title such a statement as "Photograph by U. S. Geological
Survey (David Whits)."</p>


<p class="caption3">SPECIMENS.</p>

<p class="caption4">GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.</p>

<p>Specimens other than fossils that are to be illustrated in a report
should be photographed before they are submitted, but the requisition
for the photographs should be initialed by the chief illustrator,
who will indicate the kinds of prints needed. Duplicate photographs
of the specimens should be made up into temporary plates by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
author and submitted with his other illustrations, the specimens being
retained subject to call, if needed, when the illustrations are
finally prepared. Should a colored illustration of a specimen be
needed, however, the specimen must be submitted with the report,
and a different kind of print, preferably one made on platinum or
other special paper, will be obtained by the section of illustrations.</p>

<p class="caption4">BORROWED AND FRAGILE SPECIMENS.</p>

<p>In submitting specimens to be illustrated an author should call
attention to those that have been borrowed and to those that are
fragile. Borrowed specimens will receive first attention, so that they
may be returned promptly.</p>

<p class="caption4">TRANSMITTAL OF PALEONTOLOGIC SPECIMENS.</p>

<p>All requests for paleontologic illustrations should be addressed to
the Director. The letter of transmittal should state the title of the
paper, the form of publication desired (bulletin, professional paper,
or monograph), and the status of the manuscript, whether completed
or in preparation. If the paper is unfinished an estimate of the
number of illustrations required should be given, and the special reasons
for prompt preparation should be fully stated. A letter transmitting
a second or third lot of fossils should refer to the preceding
lot or lots if all the fossils are to be used in illustrating the same
paper.</p>

<p>Fossils that are to be drawn should be sent directly to the section
of illustrations, but those that are to be photographed and require
unusual posing or that are extremely delicate and valuable may be
sent directly to the photographic laboratory to avoid repeated handling.
Each specimen or, if it is very small, each box or bottle containing
a specimen should be numbered, and each lot should be accompanied
by a list giving their names and numbers. Full instructions
as to size of reproduction, together with sketches showing the point
of view preferred and any special features to be displayed should also
be submitted. All specimens that show strong colors and all groups
of specimens that are not uniform in color will be coated by holding
them in the vapor of ammonium chloride unless directions to the
contrary are given by the author of the paper. As it may not be
desirable to apply this process to soft or fragile specimens or to
specimens that have been borrowed an author should indicate any
specimens that may not be so treated. Specimens whose color aids
in revealing detail are not so coated. If any features of a specimen
are unusual that fact should be stated so that the photographer and
the retoucher may perform their work according to the requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3">MAKING UP PLATES.</p>

<p>Two or more illustrations may be combined to form one plate in
order to permit easy and close comparison as well as for economy, for
if a particular illustration is too small to make a full plate and is
not suitable for enlargement other illustrations that are closely related
to it may be put on the same plate. The size of the printed page as
given in the table on <a href="#Page_11">page 11</a> will determine the size of the plate.</p>

<p>In making up plates composed of a number of figures the author
should endeavor to group related figures together and at the same
time to observe proper regard for artistic effect, but as figures vary in
size and shape a grouping according to relations may not be possible
in some plates. If related figures can not be kept together the larger
and darker figures should be placed in the lower part of the plate
and the smaller and lighter above. If a plate consists of one large
figure and several smaller ones the large figure should be placed below
and the smaller figures above.</p>

<p>A number designating a figure should be placed immediately below
the figure, and a series of such numbers should preferably begin with
1 in the upper left corner and continue consecutively across and
down through the plate. This arrangement is not always possible,
however, on account of variations in the size of figures.</p>

<p>As drawings of fossils or other specimens are prepared separately
and grouped into plates, and as most paleontologists make up their
own plates, each in his own way, there is naturally great dissimilarity
in methods and in results. Ordinary white or light-gray cardboard
should be used, and the figures that are to make up a plate should be
arranged as stated above but not securely pasted until the grouping
is satisfactory. In trimming each drawing or photograph the author
should be careful to leave room at its lower edge for the number.
Small drawings or photographs, such as paleontologists use, when
pasted on bristol board or other board faced with tough paper are
difficult or impossible to remove without injury if they have to be
remounted; figures pasted on ordinary white or gray cardboard can
be removed without difficulty. Each plate should be made up in a
size to fit the volume or in its correct proportion to a page in the
volume in which it is to be used (see table on <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>), and each figure
should be properly oriented&mdash;that is, all vertical lines, or the vertical
axis of each specimen, should be parallel with the sides of the plate.
When the figures are being mounted care should be taken that the
mucilage or paste does not exude under pressure and cover any part
of the drawing or photograph. The same attention should be given
to pasting on numbers. Inattention to these details may produce
results that will affect the reproduction of the plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Ordinary mucilage may be used for mounting drawings and photographs,
but photo paste gives good results and is perhaps cleaner to
handle. Dry-mounting tissue is well adapted to mounting single
illustrations but not groups of figures. Liquid rubber is sometimes
used, but it is not suitable for mounting small figures, such as drawings
and photographs of fossils. It can be used satisfactorily for
mounting temporary plates and for mounting photographs in albums
and on large cards for study or exhibition; but it has not proved to
be a permanent adhesive. Its special merit is that it does not cause
either the photograph or the mounting sheet to warp. It is applied
by spreading it evenly over the back of the photograph with the
fingers. The superfluous rubber can easily be removed from the
hands and from the cards or sheets when it is dry. Anything mounted
with liquid rubber can be easily removed.</p>

<p>If a plate is to be made up of a small number of figures that require
different reductions, the author, instead of mounting or pasting the
separate figures on one card in the manner already indicated, may
draw a rectangle of the size of the printed plate and sketch within it
the several figures in their respective sizes and positions. These
"dummy" plates or layouts should be numbered as plates, and they
may bear captions and titles. The photographs or drawings represented
by the sketches should then be numbered to identify them with
the sketches on the dummy plate, and those that pertain to each plate
should be inclosed in an envelope attached to the dummy plate. A
plate made up in this manner will meet every requirement of the
photo-engraver or lithographer.</p>

<p>If a paleontologist so desires, his plates can be permanently made
up after he has transmitted his material, but he should always submit
a tentative arrangement.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="REUSE_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS" id="REUSE_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS"></a>
REUSE OF ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>

<p>If an author desires to use in modified form an illustration already
published, whether by the Geological Survey or by an outside publisher,
he should furnish a print or tracing of the illustration showing
the changes desired. If the illustration is not to be modified he
need only give the title of the volume in which it was used, with the
number of the page, figure, or plate, and he need not make a sketch
of the illustration or furnish a dummy; but its title should be quoted
and proper reference should be given in the list of illustrations. Due
credit should be given to the author or publisher.</p>

<p>The original cuts of illustrations will be kept for one year after the
report for which they were made has been published, and authors of
later reports may and should reuse, whenever practicable, any such cut
that will serve as an illustration. In the author's list of illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
such a cut should be referred to by its number as plate or figure and
the volume in which it was first used.</p>

<p>An electrotype of any cut on hand will be furnished for use in publications
other than those of the Geological Survey at the cost of
making, which is 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cents a square inch of printing surface.
The minimum charge for a single electrotype ranges from 46 to 60
cents.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="APPROVAL_OF_FINISHED_ILLUSTRATIONS" id="APPROVAL_OF_FINISHED_ILLUSTRATIONS"></a>
APPROVAL OF FINISHED ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>

<p>After the drawings for a report have been prepared they will be
submitted to the author or to the chief of his branch or division for
examination. The finished drawings will be accompanied by the
"originals," with which the author should carefully and thoroughly
compare them. After making a thorough comparison he should mark
lightly with a pencil, on the finished drawings, all necessary corrections,
or indicate his approval subject to such corrections and additions
as may be required. He should verify all type matter and other
lettering and assure himself that no mistakes have been made in
grouping the photographs into plates, especially such as have been
regrouped since they left his hands. The author's list of illustrations
will be submitted with the new drawings for this purpose.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="REVISION_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS" id="REVISION_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS"></a>
REVISION OF ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>

<p>All illustrations receive editorial revision before they are sent to
the engravers. After they are drawn they are examined with reference
to their scientific features and their accuracy, and then in turn
with reference to the correctness of geologic names and geographic
names and to errors in statement and in spelling. Each illustration
thus, before it is completed, receives critical examination by persons
qualified in particular kinds of work to detect errors or omissions.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="SUBMITTAL_OF_PROOFS" id="SUBMITTAL_OF_PROOFS"></a>
SUBMITTAL OF PROOFS.</p>

<p>The first proofs of all illustrations are submitted to an author
when he is within reach, but if he is in the field and the transmittal
of the proofs to him is likely to cause too much delay they are submitted
to the chief of the branch or division in which the report was
prepared. Second proofs of the more complicated illustrations,
particularly geologic maps, may be submitted. An author's examination
should be confined principally to the revision of the scientific
features of his illustrations, but suggestions as to general effectiveness
are always acceptable.</p>

<p>The process to be used in engraving each illustration is stamped in
its lower left corner. In examining proofs an author should note
the following facts:</p>

<p>1. Changes can not be made in zinc etchings except by eliminating
parts, cutting away defects, and connecting lines. If additions are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
required reengraving is generally necessary, and reengraving should
preferably be avoided.</p>

<p>2. Changes can be made in half-tone plates only by re-etching certain
parts to make them lighter and by burnishing certain parts to
make them darker. If the proof shows a general loss of detail the
fault may lie either in the proving of the cut or in the reproduction.
If it is in the reproduction it can not be remedied without reengraving.
A slight loss of detail may be expected in all half tones, especially
in those that are smaller than the copy submitted.</p>

<p>3. Minor changes can be made in photolithographs and chromolithographs,
but changes can not be made twice in one place without
danger of affecting the printing. It is customary to approve all
lithographic proofs subject to the corrections indicated, the printed
edition being examined and compared, but if the changes are numerous
and radical second proofs may be required. Second combined
proofs of chromolithographs are very expensive. (See <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>.)</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="PROOF_READING_ILLUSTRATIONS" id="PROOF_READING_ILLUSTRATIONS"></a>
PROOF READING ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>


<p>An author should examine the proofs of his illustrations closely
and should compare them carefully with the original drawings.
A mere cursory examination may fail to detect errors that have not
been caught by the regular proof reader. Every correction desired
should be clearly indicated with pen and ink in the body of the proof
and inclosed in a loop from which a line should be carried to a
marginal note or comment, but if the time available is short a pencil
may be used. In correcting type matter or lettering (such as that
in a geologic legend or explanation) the ordinary proof reader's
marks should be used. The author or the person examining the proofs
should initial each one at the place indicated by a rubber stamp.</p>

<p>Proofs should be held only long enough to examine them properly
and to compare them with the original illustrations, for a time limit
is fixed in each contract for engraving, and if the author holds proofs
beyond a reasonable time he causes a delay in the fulfillment of the
contract.</p>

<p>As the illustrations for many reports contain important data that
will be discussed in the text, proofs of illustrations can not be supplied
to any applicant without consent from the Director's office.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="GENERAL_CONSIDERATIONS" id="GENERAL_CONSIDERATIONS"></a>
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</p>

<p>The following requirements are essential to obtain good original
illustrations:</p>

<p>1. The material selected should be pertinent and expressive; it
should have the qualities essential to good illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The character of the report and the size of the illustrations
should be kept clearly in mind. If the report is preliminary or
ephemeral the illustrations should be simple and inexpensive. If
the report represents the sum of knowledge on the subject treated or
the last word on some particular area the illustrations may be more
elaborate. The character of a report generally determines the form
of publication, which, in turn, determines the size of the pages and
the size of the plates and figures. Every sketch made should be
larger than publication size&mdash;preferably twice publication size&mdash;whether
it is a simple diagram or a base map.</p>

<p>3. The kind of reproduction that is apparently needed should be
fully considered, for it should have some relation to the kind of
report. The illustrations for short-lived reports are reproduced
by the cheaper processes. Those for hurried reports are reproduced
by processes that can be worked quickly, but no process should be
considered that will not give a clear reproduction of essential details.</p>

<p>4. Clearness of preparation of original matter is invariably essential.
An author should not expect the draftsmen or the editors to
supply missing links. Each original should be complete and should
be so made that it can be understood and followed without question.
Changes made in the finished drawings or on proof sheets are expensive
and delay publication.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="Part_II" id="Part_II"></a>
<span class="smcap">Part II. Preparation By Draftsmen.</span></p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="GENERAL_DIRECTIONS" id="GENERAL_DIRECTIONS"></a>
GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</p>

<p>The work of preparing illustrations such as are used in the reports
of the Geological Survey is essentially that of making finished drawings
from more or less crude and imperfect material furnished by
authors to illustrate certain features or phenomena discussed in their
manuscripts. Each finished drawing must be so prepared that it can
be reproduced in multiple by one of several processes of engraving.
The author's sketches and other material are commonly called "originals";
the finished illustrations are known by the engravers as
"copy." Though most engraver's copy consists of more or less
elaborate drawings that are to be reproduced in facsimile by "direct"
processes without the interposition of handwork, some of it
consists of more roughly prepared copy which is accurate in statement
but requires complete manual or "indirect" reproduction.
The direct processes in use are zinc etching, half-tone engraving,
photolithography, three-color half tone, photogravure, and photogelatin.
The manual or indirect processes are wax engraving, wood
engraving, engraving on copper and on stone, plain lithography, and
chromolithography. These processes are described on pages 72-90.</p>

<p>Part I of this pamphlet contains some matter that is pertinent to
final preparation and should be consulted by draftsmen.</p>

<p>To prepare a drawing that will be in every way suitable for reproduction
usually requires experience of a kind not acquired in many
other kinds of drafting, such as preparing engineers' or architects'
drawings, because the drawings themselves or blue prints made directly
from them are the things the engineer or the architect desires.
Drawings prepared for reproduction are generally made larger than
publication size, and it is therefore necessary to gage each line,
letter, or feature for a definite reduction. Engineers' and architects'
drawings generally do not require preparation for reproduction
by any process, but in preparing illustrations for the reports of the
Geological Survey reproduction must be fully considered at every
step, and each drawing must be made according to the requirements of
a certain selected process and gaged for a certain reduction. The
draftsman should therefore know how to plan each drawing step
by step for an engraved cut, a lithograph, a text figure, or a
plate, always with a definite result in view. He should be familiar
with processes of engraving and should know the special requirements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of each process, and he should be able to prepare drawings for any
specified reduction in a way to insure good, legible reproduction.</p>

<p>The geologic draftsman should read and study such textbooks of
geology as those of Dana and Geikie and should familiarize himself
with structural geology, the geologic time divisions, and geologic
nomenclature. He should be able to prepare a simple, effective illustration
from complicated rough originals and to supply minor missing
essential parts or features. To perform his work successfully
he must possess mechanical skill and some artistic taste, as well as
good eyesight and great patience.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="INSTRUMENTS" id="INSTRUMENTS"></a>
INSTRUMENTS.</p>

<p>The following list of draftsmen's instruments is practically complete.
Those which are considered indispensable are marked by
asterisks; the others may be used according to individual preference.
The same kind of instrument may be duplicated in different sizes
according to the variation in the demands of the work.</p>

<p class="caption3">CLASSIFICATION OF MATERIAL.</p>


<p>The draftsman handling the drawings and other original material
submitted by the author of a report for its illustration should first
group them, as far as possible, into kinds or classes, in order that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he may decide how each illustration should be prepared (1) to express
most effectively the author's purpose, (2) to insure reasonable
economy in preparation and in reproduction, and (3) to meet the requirements
of the processes of reproduction selected. All similar
illustrations for one publication should be prepared in the same general
style. In a series of geologic sections, for example, the same
lithologic symbols should be used throughout for the same kinds of
rocks. The titles, explanations, and captions of the maps should also
agree with one another in general style and in details of workmanship.</p>

<p>The draftsman should determine in advance the reduction for each
drawing or for each group of drawings, in order that he may use
the same size of letters or the same kinds of type for the lettering on
a series of drawings that require the same reduction. The reduction
should preferably be marked in fractions (as "<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> off," "<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> off" or
"reduce <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>," "reduce <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>"), and the choice of the same reduction for a
group of drawings will not only insure greater uniformity in the
drafting and in the reproduction but will permit the drawings to be
reproduced more economically, for the engraver can photograph them
in groups instead of each one separately.</p>

<p>The draftsman should therefore note and consider (1) the special
features shown in the author's originals; (2) whether or not these
features have been plainly indicated and whether the originals are
complete; (3) the size of the printed page of the volume in which
the illustrations will appear and the reduction required for each
drawing; and (4) the process by which each drawing should be reproduced.
If an original is of doubtful or uncertain interpretation
or appears to be incomplete the draftsman should confer with the
author of the paper if he is within reach or should bring the matter
to the attention of the chief of the branch; otherwise he may waste
much time in making the drawing.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="PREPARATION_OF_MAPS" id="PREPARATION_OF_MAPS"></a>
PREPARATION OF MAPS.</p>


<p class="caption3">PROJECTION.</p>

<p>The base maps furnished by authors (see pp. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>-<a href="#Page_14">14</a>) are prepared
in many different ways and in different degrees of refinement and of
crudity, but the work of redrawing them for reproduction involves
well-established and generally uniform principles. All maps except
those of very extensive areas should be based on a map projection
which will show with a minimum of distortion the effect of the curvature
of the earth. The polyconic projection (see <a href="#Figure_5">fig. 5</a>) is used for
most Government maps. In this projection the central meridian is a
straight vertical line, and each parallel of latitude is developed independently
of the others. The mathematical elements of map projection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are given in tables published by the Geological Survey<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the
Coast and Geodetic Survey.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <a href="#Figure_5">Figure 5</a>, however, illustrates the mechanical
or constructional features of the polyconic projection and if
used in connection with the published tables will probably be a sufficient
guide for projecting a map on any desired scale.</p>

</div>

<p>In projecting a map first select a convenient measuring scale for
setting off the dimensions given in the tables, or if no scale is at
hand one may be constructed. Measuring scales are made, however,
bearing divisions for miles and kilometers and finer subdivisions of
6 to 100 parts. They include the ratios of 1:31,250, 1:31,680, 1:48,000,
1:62,500, 1:63,360, 1:125,000, 1:250,000, 1:500,000, 1:1,000,000,
and others. On a map drawn on the scale of 1 to 63,360, for example,
1 inch would represent 1 mile; on a map drawn on the scale of 1 to
1,000,000, 1 millimeter would represent 1 kilometer, and so on. It will
be seen that the use of a scale that shows in ratios, such as those just
given, the actual distance on the ground as compared with the unit
representing the same distance on the map will reduce the possibility
of error.</p>

<p>The method of projecting a map, illustrated in the accompanying
diagram (<a href="#Figure_5">fig. 5</a>), is as follows: First draw a straight vertical line
(A) through the middle of the sheet to represent the central meridian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the map and a line (B) at the lower end of this line exactly at
right angles to it to represent the bottom of the map. Then set off
on the line showing the central meridian the distances between
parallels given in Table 6 on page 36 of "Geographic tables and
formulas" (Bull. 650). It should be noted that the figures in these
tables give the distance, in meters and statute miles, of 1&deg; on a
meridian measured 30' each way from a point where the meridian is
intersected by a parallel. The exact distances between parallels as
measured on the ground are given in the Coast and Geodetic Survey
tables, or they may be computed from Table 6 of "Geographic tables
and formulas" by adding the sum of the figures given for any two
latitudes 1&deg; apart and dividing by 2.</p>

<p>The distance between parallels that are 2&deg; apart, as shown in the
diagram, may be computed from Table 6 of "Geographic tables and
formulas," as follows:</p>

<table summary="Distance">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>Meters.</td>
  <td>Meters.</td>

<tr>
  <td>1&deg; of latitude on 37th parallel</td>
  <td>= 100,975.1 &divide; 2 = </td>

<tr>
  <td>True distance from 35&deg; to 37&deg; latitude</td>
  <td class="tdr">= </td>
  <td class="tdr">221,912.5</td>

</table>

<p>The distances given in the diagram were obtained by adding the
figures given in the Coast and Geodetic Survey tables, which yield
the same results. Other tables in Bulletin 650 give the true distances
in inches on maps of certain standard scales.</p>

<p>Through the points thus obtained on the central meridian draw
lines at right angles to the vertical line. Along these horizontal
lines lay off the dimensions in the column headed X, Table 6 (pp.
39-47) of "Geographic tables and formulas" as required for each
individual map&mdash;in the diagram every alternate degree. Draw vertical
lines at these points and set off the distance Y in the same table
in a similar manner, and the points so found will be the points of intersection
of the respective meridians and parallels. Figures are
given on the diagram for the thirty-fifth parallel only.</p>


<p class="caption3">DETAILS OF BASE MAPS.</p>

<p>Anyone who attempts to draw a base map must, first of all, know
how each feature or part of the map should be represented. Most of
the conventional symbols for features shown on base maps are well
established and should invariably be used; for instance, a line composed
of alternate long and short dashes (not dashes and dots) represents
a county boundary, and a line or two parallel lines across which
short lines are drawn at regular intervals represents a railroad. If
he finds that two or more symbols have been widely used to represent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the same feature the draftsman should select the one that is best
suited to the map in hand. The correct forms of the conventional
symbols or features to be used in preparing miscellaneous maps are
shown in <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV</a>, but the size and weight of each line or symbol must
depend on the size and character of the map.</p>


<p class="caption3">TRANSFERRING OF COPYING.</p>

<p class="caption4">TRACING.</p>

<p>The oldest method of transferring a map or parts of a map or
other drawing to another sheet is that of copying it by means of
tracing paper. This method, though still used for simple work, has
given way to quicker and more effective methods. By one of these
methods a piece of thin, fairly smooth paper (not necessarily transparent)
is coated with graphite by rubbing over it a soft pencil.
When the graphite has been evenly distributed over it, this sheet is
laid upon the drawing paper, coated side down, the map or other subject
to be copied is laid upon the graphite-coated sheet, and the two
outer sheets&mdash;the drawing paper and the map&mdash;are securely fastened
together. By a steel tracing point or very hard pencil the lines and
other details of the matter to be copied are then firmly and carefully
traced and thus transferred to the clean drawing paper beneath.</p>

<p>For maps that show several features in different colors sheets
rubbed with blue, orange, brown, or green pencils may be used, one
after another, for tracing each set of the features. Red should not
be used, as it is not easily erased. This method insures distinctive
lines for the separate features and prevents the confusion that might
result from the use of one color only. Exact register of the features
shown in the several colors used may be insured by fastening one
edge of the drawing to be copied to the drawing paper by mucilage
or thumb tacks. The colored sheets may then be slipped in and out
without altering the position of the lines or symbols for one set of
data with relation to those for the others.</p>

<p>In the final preparation of a base map to be engraved and printed
in colors&mdash;for example, black, blue, and brown&mdash;tracings of the three
colors appearing on the original base should generally be transferred,
as described above, to one sheet of paper and thus worked up into
a three-colored map. It is usually unnecessary and undesirable to
draw each color on a separate sheet. The preparation of separate
drawings may facilitate reproduction, but if they are made on tracing
cloth the usual uneven shrinking or stretching of the cloth may produce
misregister in the printing; therefore it is safer to make a single
drawing, so that the photolithographer can make three negatives and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
separate the colors by painting out or "opaquing" the colors not
wanted on each negative. A map drawn on a single sheet is also
less bulky and can therefore be more conveniently handled and compared
with proof.</p>

<p>If for any reason separate tracings for the different colors to be
used on a map are considered desirable they should be made on linen
cut from one roll and in the same direction according to the warp
and woof.</p>

<p class="caption4">CELLULOID TRANSFERRING.</p>

<p>In the celluloid method of transferring a map or parts of a map
to paper upon which a complete new map is to be drawn the map or
part of the map to be copied is photographed to the exact scale of
the new drawing and reproduced in graphite on thin sheets of
celluloid.</p>

<p>The celluloid sheet is then laid face down in the correct position
on the drawing paper and firmly rubbed on the back with a steel
burnisher, which makes a perfect offset of the map on the paper.
After the parts desired are inked over the rest of the graphite print
is easily erased with an ordinary rubber.</p>

<p>By using this method it is possible to get absolute scale and more
satisfactory results than by tracing over a photographic print line
for line or by using a pantograph.</p>

<p>Requisitions for celluloid prints are made on the form used for
requesting photolithographic work.</p>

<p class="caption4">SKETCHING BY RETICULATION.</p>

<p>If the sheet bearing the design or matter to be copied may be
marred without objection it is ruled lightly into pencil squares of
equal size. Corresponding squares of the same size, larger, or
smaller, according to the size of the new drawing, are then ruled on
the drawing paper, and the work is sketched square by square. If
the original sheet may not be marred the same result can be obtained
by drawing the lines on a transparent oversheet. This method is
serviceable for enlarging or reducing simple work that includes no
great amount of detail; if great precision of detail is required the
original should be enlarged or reduced by photography or by the
pantograph.</p>

<p class="caption4">THE "SHADOWLESS DRAFTING TABLE."</p>

<p>One of the most useful contrivances that has been made for tracing
a drawing on the same scale is called by its manufacturers the
"shadowless drafting table." The essential features of this table are
a wooden box inclosing strong incandescent lights and bearing a
ground-glass top. A drawing placed on the ground glass can be so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
illuminated as to make its lines conspicuous and readily traceable
even through relatively thick paper. The table is particularly useful
for tracing sheets upon, which the lines are indistinct and would
not be discernible under tracing paper with reflected light. It is also
useful in preparing drawings in which certain features must register
perfectly over each other. In fact any drawing that does not require
enlarging or reducing can be traced with great facility by the use
of this drafting table, and it is particularly useful for tracing faint
lines on old and poorly preserved prints or drawings.</p>

<p>Such a table has been installed in the section of illustrations, where
it can be used by authors and others.</p>


<p class="caption3">TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES.</p>

<p class="caption4">RELIEF.</p>

<p>The effect of relief is expressed on a map by three methods&mdash;by
contours, by hachures, and by shading. (See <a href="#Figure_6">fig. 6</a>.) The first
method does not give pronounced pictorial expression of relief,
though it gives correct shape and exact elevation; the others are mow
pictorial, but they do not give exact elevation.</p>

<p><i>Contours.</i>&mdash;As contoured maps are originally prepared from actual
surveys the draftsman should simply follow the copy furnished by
the topographer or such original matter as may be given to him for
redrawing. If the area mapped is large and the contours are close
together the original may be transferred by celluloid tracing (see
<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>), or it may be transferred by tracing with graphite-coated
paper (see <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>). After the contour lines have been transferred
they should be traced in ink, in lines of even thickness, except those
that represent certain fixed intervals and are to be numbered, which
should be made slightly thicker. (See <a href="#Figure_6">fig. 6, A</a>.) In drawing these
lines some draftsmen use an ordinary ruling pen, others the swivel
pen; but considerable practice is required in the use of either before
it can be controlled to follow precisely the penciled lines. Still
other draftsmen use the Shepard pen or an ordinary drawing pen.
The swivel pen, if expertly handled, produces a firm and even line.</p>

<p>Italic numbers should be used to indicate the elevation of a contour
and should be placed in an opening in the line, never between
lines. Where the lines run close together great care should be taken
that they do not touch unless the interspaces are so narrow that they
must touch and combine. The lines should be firm and even, and if
the copy or original map shows that they are uniformly very close
together it should be enlarged before the tracing is made in order to
give more freedom in drawing; but if the enlarged map is to be
much reduced care should be taken to make the lines proportionate
to the reduction. A photo-engraving of a map on which the contour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
lines are drawn very close together is likely to be unsatisfactory because,
though the spaces between the lines are reduced in width, the
lines themselves may show no corresponding reduction in thickness.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 379px;">
<a name="Figure_6" id="Figure_6"></a>
<a href="images/figure06_lrg.png"><img src="images/figure06.png" width="379" height="525" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Figure 6.&mdash;Methods of expressing relief: (A) by contour lines, (B) by hachures, (C) by
shading on stipple board, and (D) by a brush drawing. The four examples given represent
the same area. The drawings were made twice the size of the printed cuts.</span>
</div>

<p>Certain contour lines are commonly accentuated on a map, generally
every fourth or fifth line&mdash;that is, for a 10-foot interval every
50-foot line, for a 20-foot interval every 100-foot line, for a 25-foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
interval every 100-foot line, for a 50-foot interval every 250-foot line,
and for a 100-foot interval every 500-foot line.</p>

<p><i>Hachuring.</i>&mdash;The effect of relief can be produced satisfactorily by
hachuring but only by a draftsman who has had considerable well-directed
practice in that kind of drawing. In a hachured map the
light should seem to come from the west or northwest&mdash;that is, the
darker parts should be on the east or southeast side of an elevation
and the lighter parts on the west or northwest The highest elevation
should be represented by the darkest shade on the right and by
a corresponding high light on the left. The hachuring should begin
at the crest of a peak, range, or butte and be worked downward
toward the gentler slopes, the lines being drawn farther apart and
made thinner until the floor of the valley is reached and the effect of
shadow is lost by fewer and lighter lines. On a hachured map that
is made from a contoured map somewhat definite differences of
elevation may be indicated by the intervals between the strokes, and
abrupt changes in slope may be indicated by shorter and heavier
lines. The strokes should be disjointed, and they should trend at
right angles to the upper margin of a cliff and should radiate from
a peak. <a href="#Figure_6">Figure 6, B</a>, represents satisfactory hachuring.</p>

<p><i>Hill shading.</i>&mdash;Relief is more easily expressed by shading than by
hachuring. (See <a href="#Figure_6">fig. 6, C, D</a>.) The draftsman can best express it
by this means after he has studied contoured maps or photographs
of the region mapped, if they are available, in order that he may
obtain an idea of the details of its topography.</p>

<p>The special means used to produce hill shading will depend on
the character of surface of the paper on which the drawing is to be
made, the size of the map, the amount of detail and refinement of
execution desired, and the amount of reduction to be made in reproducing
the drawing. For maps on which it is desired to show
some refinement of drawing and detail, a lithographic or wax crayon
can be used on paper which has a grained surface. The draftsman
must express relief according to the information he has at hand,
whether detailed or general, and must employ methods that accord
with the purpose of the map and the mode of reproduction selected.
If a shaded relief map is to be prepared for direct reproduction by
photolithography and the shading is to be printed in a separate
color the base map should be completed first and a light photographic
or blue print obtained on which to add the relief in black
lithographic crayon, to insure perfect fitting of the relief and the
base; or the relief can be prepared on an oversheet&mdash;a semitransparent
white paper with sufficient "tooth" or grain to cut the shading
up into minute dots. The shadowless drafting table (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>)
is especially useful for this purpose. On this oversheet register
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
marks should be placed at the four comers and at several other points,
particularly at the intersection of parallels and meridians.</p>

<p>For relief shading on small black and white maps Ross's hand-stipple
drawing paper may be used. (See <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>.) By rubbing a
black wax crayon or pencil over the surface of the paper the desired
effect is produced in fine dots or in stipple, which may be varied
in density of shade at the will of the draftsman. (See <a href="#Figure_6">fig. 6, C</a>.)
High lights can be produced by scraping away the chalky surface of
the paper. A lithographic or wax crayon is the best medium to use
on this stipple paper, as on the paper referred to in the preceding
paragraph, for the shading produced by it is not so easily smeared
as that produced in pastel or by a graphite pencil. The object of
using either the rough paper or Boss's stipple paper for drawings
that are to be reproduced by photo-engraving is to produce a shading
that is broken up into dots of varying sizes, which is essential in such
reproduction.</p>

<p>Belief shading for maps can also be made with a brush in flat
washes of either india ink or lampblack. Such shading should be
made only over a blue print or an impression of some kind from the
map upon which the shading or relief is to be overprinted. If the
relief is expressed on the author's original by contours the general
shapes of the relief and the drainage lines can be traced and transferred
lightly in blue lines to form a base on which to model the
shading and at the same time to make the shading fit the streams.
Such a drawing can be photographed through a screen and reproduced
by half tone (see <a href="#Figure_6">fig. 6, D</a>) or mezzotint as a separate plate
made to overprint the map in another color.</p>

<p class="caption4">HYDROGRAPHY.</p>

<p><i>General directions.</i>&mdash;The drainage features of a map should be so
drawn as to suggest the natural courses of the streams. Streams
should not be drawn in straight, hard lines, as such lines are decidedly
unnatural and produce a crude effect. The course of a river
may be straight in general, but it is likely to be somewhat sinuous in
detail. If the streams shown on a preliminary map are drawn in a
clumsy or characterless fashion they should be redrawn with a
freehand effect or made slightly wavy, in order that they may
appear more natural. The gradual widening of streams from source
to mouth should also be shown in the drawing. On small-scale maps,
where the eye can at once see a stream through its full length, this
almost imperceptible widening can be expressed by a line of almost
uniform weight except for the stretch near the source, where it should
grow thinner and taper off. On maps which are to be reproduced
directly from drawings in black and white and which are to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
both contour lines and drainage the lines representing the streams
and other water bodies should generally be drawn freehand and
slightly heavier than the contour lines, which should be sharper and
more precise.</p>

<p>The names of all streams or other bodies of water should be in
italic letters, those of the larger streams being lettered in capitals
and those of the smaller streams in capitals and lower-case letters.
(See "Lettering," <a href="#LETTERING">p. 53</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Water lining.</i>&mdash;The use of water lining on black and white maps
should be limited to maps on which the water areas are not readily
distinguishable from the land areas. In rough drawings that are to
serve only as copy for engravers a flat color may be used for water
areas and its conversion into water lines specified. In base maps to
be reproduced in three colors a light-blue tint may be used in lieu
of water lining, and it can be printed either flat or in a fine ruling
transferred to the stone that is to print the drainage. The engraving
of water lines is expensive, and the flat blue color should generally be
preferred.</p>

<p>Water lining usually consists of 30 to 45 lines on engraved or
large maps, but on small maps and sketch maps the number may
be reduced as desired. Care should be taken that the lines are as
nearly parallel as they can be made freehand and of even weight
or thickness. The first three to six lines outside the coast line should
be somewhat closer together than those farther out and should conform
closely to the coast line, but the spacing between the lines should
increase and the lines should become almost imperceptibly less conformable
to the coast line as they reach their outer limit, the last
three to six being made with the greatest care and refinement.
Water-lined maps that are to be reproduced by photographic processes
should be drawn at least twice publication size. The reduction will
bring the lines closer together, and the reproduction will show a more
refined effect than could possibly be produced by the most skillful
drawing.</p>

<p>Good examples of water lining, such as are shown on the topographic
atlas sheets of the Survey, should be studied by draftsmen
before they undertake such work.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="LETTERING" id="LETTERING"></a>LETTERING.</p>

<p class="caption4">GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</p>

<p>The cultural features are named on maps by letters of two distinct
styles&mdash;slanting gothic for public works and roman for habitations
and civil divisions. The size of the letters used should indicate in a
general way the relative importance of the feature or group to which
they are applied, but on some maps the county seats, State capitals,
and large cities may be distinguished by different symbols. The
names of civil divisions are lettered in sizes depending on their
relative grade and the size of the area or space in which the names
are to appear.</p>

<p>The features shown on a topographic map may be broadly separated
into four groups and are lettered as follows:</p>

<p>Civil divisions (countries, States, counties, townships, land grants,
reservations, cities, towns, villages, settlements, schools, lodges,
ranches, etc.), roman capitals or capitals and lower case.</p>

<p>Public works (railroads, tunnels, roads, canals, ferries, bridges,
fords, dams, mains, mines, forts, trails, etc.), slanting gothic capitals
(light) or capitals and lower case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Hydrographic features (oceans, seas, gulfs, bays, lakes, ponds,
rivers, creeks, brooks, springs, wells, falls, rapids, marshes, glaciers,
etc.), italic capitals or capitals and lower case.</p>

<p>Hypsographic features (mountains, ranges, peaks, plateaus, cliffs,
buttes, canyons, valleys, peninsulas, islands, capes, etc.), upright
gothic capitals (light) or capitals and lower case.</p>

<p>The essential principles of lettering have been described in numerous
treatises and are well understood by most draftsmen. The correct
form of each letter may be learned from such treatises, but spacing
and arrangement are best learned by observation and experience.
Good lettering will not strongly attract attention, but even slight
imperfections of form, spacing, slant, and shading will be quickly
detected and criticized. Map letterers should note that the name of
a place or the number of a symbol should be put to the right of the
symbol if possible and a little above or below it&mdash;not to the left and
directly on a line with it, as Tucson<b>o</b>, 17<b>o</b>, Dallas<b>o</b>, Carson<b>o</b>. Names
indicating large areas, if written from west to east, should curve with
the parallels, and all names should be so lettered that "if they should
fall they would fall on their feet." Every name should be distinctly
legible but not so conspicuous as to subordinate the feature it designates.
Lines should therefore not be broken in order to make the
lettering clear except where there is possible danger that the smaller
spaces may be filled up in printing. The lettering on a map should
always be so spaced that it will properly fit the area it is intended
to designate. In names consisting of two or more words the letters
should not be closely spaced if wide spaces are left between the words.
In numbers, except those used to indicate elevations on contour Lines
or elsewhere, thousands should always be set off by commas.</p>

<p>Draftsmen often draw bad forms for commas, quotation marks,
apostrophes, and question marks. The following forms are correct:
Comma , ; quotation marks "" ; apostrophe ' ; question mark ? .</p>

<p class="caption4">LETTERING BY TYPE.</p>

<p>Names and short notes printed from type on paper, to be cut out
and pasted in proper positions on maps or other drawings, now furnish
a large proportion of the lettering on the Survey's illustrations.
The strips are likely to become detached by the repeated handling
of a drawing, however, unless they are securely pasted on. The best
results can be obtained by having the type printed on a special brand
of "noncurling" gummed paper, from which the lettering is cut
in squares or strips, which are dampened and applied to the proper
places on the drawing. In handling such strips a pair of dentist's
tweezers is useful. When mucilage is applied to printed strips of
ordinary paper the moisture causes the paper to warp or curl, often
so much as to affect the reproduction of the drawing. This printed
lettering is generally used, however, only for headings, titles, notes,
and other matter that stands alone; it should not be used for the
geographic names in the body of a map unless only a few names are
to appear, for the strips of paper bearing the names may obscure
parts of the map. The reproduction of this lettering by photo-engraving
or photolithography gives results superior to those obtained
from hand lettering unless each letter is made with the utmost
care, work which is considered a waste of time.</p>

<p>Type is used also for printing lettering directly on a drawing

a self-inking stamp.</p>

<p>Most of the styles and sizes of type now used on maps in the Survey's
reports are shown in <a href="#Plate_V">Plate V</a>.</p>

<p>If a drawing is to be reduced one-half the smallest type used
should be about 2 millimeters in height; if it is to be reduced one-third
the smallest type used should be about 1.5 millimeters in
height; and so on. No letter whose vertical height after reproduction
would be less than about 1 millimeter should be used, and the
larger lettering should bear a proper relation to the smaller. Sheets
showing the styles of type in use by the Survey, in full size and reduced
one-fourth, one-third, two-fifths, one-half, three-fifths, two-thirds,
and three-fourths, will be furnished on request. If a drawing
is to be reduced one-half, for example, the sheet that has been
reduced one-half will show the size of the lettering on the printed
plate, so that the draftsman, by referring to the sheet showing the
reduction he desires, can select type of a size that will be legible.

<p>Words like mount, river, point should not be abbreviated where they
form a part of the name of a city or town, as Rocky Mount, Fall
River, West Point. Neither the word nor the abbreviation for railroad

<p>The abbreviations used on the margins of maps for subdivisions
of land should be as follows (note punctuation): T. 2 N., E. 3 W.
On large-scale plats the marginal lettering should be as follows:

fractions use half and quarter, not one-half and one-quarter.</p>

<p>The abbreviated forms of such names as North Fork and South
Fork should be N. Fork and S. Fork, not North Fk. and South Fk.</p>

<p>The abbreviations for number and numbers before figures are No.
and Nos. The o should never be raised, as in N<sup>o</sup>. The abbreviation
for Mac is Mc, not M<sup>c</sup>.</p>

<p>All periods should be omitted from abbreviations used in the body
of a map unless their omission would cause misunderstanding. They
are generally unnecessary, and if used on some maps they are likely
to be mistaken for symbols representing certain features, such as
houses or flowing wells, if either is shown. Periods used on drawings
that are to be reproduced "direct" or photomechanically should
always be slightly exaggerated.</p>

<p class="caption4">NAMES OF RAILROADS.</p>

<p>The names of railroads may be written in full or abbreviated, in
accordance with the kind of map and the space available. On a
sketch map in black and white the initial letters are generally sufficient.
On a more detailed map, if there is room enough, the names
may be spelled out. As already stated, neither the words "railroad"
and "railway" nor the abbreviations R. R. and Ry. should be used
on a map.</p>


<p class="caption3">MAKE-UP OF MAPS.</p>

<p class="caption4">FORMS FOR CERTAIN FEATURES.</p>

<p>The proper forms for certain features of maps, such as the borders,
titles, explanations, bar scales, captions, arrows indicating true north
and magnetic declination, source, and authorship, are shown in
<a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>. Note particularly the style and position of the marginal
matter.</p>

<p class="caption4">BORDER.</p>

<p>A finished map border is used or omitted according to the kind
of map prepared. Diagrammatic maps and maps on which no parallels
and meridians appear do not need finished borders. On a map
that shows complete areal geologic or other coloring, such as a map
in a Survey geologic folio, the border lines tend to destroy the simple
effect of the whole map. On a map that is not completely colored
and on all very large maps borders are really necessary. If borders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are used, however, the space between the neat line and the outer line
of the border should be only sufficient to provide proper space for
the numbers showing latitude and longitude or township and range.
A simple rule<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for determining the width of this space is as follows:
Divide the sum of the dimensions of the map by 2 and find the
square root of the quotient, which will represent the width of the
border in sixteenths of an inch. Example: Map is 20 by 30 inches;
(20 + 30)/2 = 25; square root of 25 = 5; width of border = <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Worked out by Martin Solem, of the U. S. Geological Survey.</p></div>

<p>The numbers showing latitude and longitude should be in shaded
arabic numerals and those showing township and range in gothic.
The symbols for degree, minute, and second should not be crowded.
On a map that has no added border lines the numbers should be in
hair-line gothic.</p>

<p class="caption4">TITLE.</p>

<p>The title of a map should be in roman letters and if placed at the
lower margin should generally be arranged in two lines, unless it
is short. If it forms two or more lines the lines should be well balanced.
The first line should describe the position of the area; the
second line should state the purpose of the map, as</p>

<p class="caption3">MAP OF BUTTE AND VICINITY, MONTANA<br />
<span class="smaller">SHOWING LOCATION OF MINES AND PROSPECTS.</span></p>

<p>A title placed inside the border of a map should be arranged in
a series of lines, generally beginning with "Map of" or "Geologic
map of." and the line showing the dominant part of the title should
be emphasized by larger lettering, thus:</p>

<p class="caption3" style="line-height:1.25em;"><span class="smaller">MAP OF</span><br />
THE VICINITY OF BUTTE<br />
MONTANA<br />
<span class="smaller">SHOWING LOCATION OF MINES AND PROSPECTS.</span></p>

<p>The name of the author or compiler of a map or of the person
supplying the geologic or other data shown on it may be placed either
beneath the title or in the lower right corner, just below the border
line, and the names of the topographers or the source of the base
should be stated in the lower left corner, just below the border line.
If the title is placed inside the border all notes giving credit for
any part or features of the map may be placed beneath the title or
scale. (See <a href="#Plate_VII">PI. VII</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption4">EXPLANATION.</p>

<p>The symbols, patterns, or colors used on a map should be given in
a series of rectangles or "boxes," accompanied by explanatory
terms in the form shown in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>, headed "Explanation." If
the explanation is small a convenient place for it on some maps
may be found within the neat lines. If no space is available there,
or if it is so large that there is not room to place it there without
obscuring other details, it may be placed either vertically along
the right margin, as shown in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>, or horizontally under the
title. A geologic explanation should preferably be arranged vertically,
as in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>, so as to show the relative age of the formations
by the positions of the boxes. This explanation should be
carefully worked out in pencil by the draftsman and approved by
the committee on geologic names before it is drawn in ink, in order
to save time in making corrections.</p>

<p>In lettering the explanation roman letters or type should be used
for the titles under the boxes and italic of smaller size for the subtitles
or descriptive detail, which should be inclosed in parentheses.
The names of geologic periods and systems should be in gothic capitals,
the names of series or groups should be in italic lower case, and
the limit of each period, system, or group should be indicated by
braces. The general style and arrangement shown in the Survey's
geologic folios should be followed, and this and the arrangement of
other matter is shown in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>. Care should be taken not to crowd
the explanation, and if corrections are necessary they should be so
made that each line of the matter in which they appear will be properly
spaced.</p>

<p>The explanation for a map that is to be engraved or to be reproduced
by lithography need only be sketched in to show general style
and arrangement. The engraver or the lithographer will supply
such matter in proper form according to specifications. For direct
reproduction, however, as by photolithography or zinc etching, the
lettering must either be carefully drawn with pen or printed from
type on slips, which are pasted on the drawing.</p>

<p class="caption4">GRAPHIC SCALES FOR MAPS.</p>

<p>A bar scale for miles or feet should be given on every map, and if
the map is of international interest the metric scale should be given
just beneath the scale of miles or feet. The accepted designs for
these scales are shown in <a href="#Figure_7">figure 7</a>. The scale should be accompanied
W any necessary statement pertaining to the base map, such as "Contour
interval 20 feet," "Datum is mean sea level." The fractional
scale (<img src="images/scale.png" width="43" height="27" style="position: relative; top: 0.5em;" alt="1/250,000" />,
for example) should be given on all except the more
simple kinds of maps, and the date of publication should also
appear just below the scale or scales. The single-line bar scale
should be used only on small or simple maps. The length of
the bar scale must depend on the size of the map and the space
available. Those shown in <a href="#Figure_7">figure 7</a> were made over blue prints from
scales used by the Survey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>To make a bar scale for a map of unknown scale that shows only
a single meridian and parallel, or for a map on which no meridians
or parallels are shown, first ascertain the distance between two
points shown on the map by
reference to other authentic
maps. If, for example, the
distance between two such
points is 16.315 miles draw
a horizontal line (<i>a</i> in <a href="#Figure_8">fig. 8</a>)
representing this distance on the map, and at
its end, at right angles
to it, draw another line (<i>b</i>)
actually measuring 16.315
units of any convenient denomination.
Draw a
straight line (c) diagonally
between the ends of lines
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Then set off on line
<i>b</i> any convenient number
of the units selected, say 5
or 10, and project from the
points set off lines exactly
parallel with line <i>c</i> to line
<i>a</i>. The distance and the
number of the units thus
marked on line a will indicate the number of miles covered by that
distance on the map, as shown in <a href="#Figure_8">figure 8</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption4">SYMBOLS.</p>

<p>Symbols should be drawn with as much care as letters, though to
a critic they may not appear so bad as poor lettering unless he finds
them glaringly large or so small that he can discover or identify them
only with difficulty. The size of a symbol must depend on its importance
on the map bearing it. On a map that shows numerous
mines, for instance, the crossed hammers or the symbols for shafts
should be not only visible but conspicuous. The draftsman who is to
make such a map must know beforehand how much his drawing will
be reduced in reproduction and must make the symbols in proportion
to the reduction. The symbols shown in <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>
(<a href="#Plate_II">p. 20</a>) should be
used in all the Survey's illustrations where they are appropriate.</p>

<p class="caption4">AREAL PATTERNS FOR BLACK AND WHITE MAPS.</p>

<p>The conventional patterns used on a map to distinguish separate
areas, chiefly geologic, are shown in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII</a>. The patterns shown
represent the proper combinations of lines, dots, and other forms and
should be spaced openly or closely according to the size of the area
covered, the contrast needed between areas, and the general clearness
and effect desired. If a map is to show both small and large areas
dense or closely spaced patterns should generally be used for the
smaller areas, even if they may be required for some fairly large areas
representing the same formation or condition. On the other hand,
open patterns should be used for large areas. Again, it may be necessary
to make certain areas more conspicuous than others, and this
effect can be best produced by drawing the lines closer together rather
than by making them heavier, unless the area covered is small or unless
a closely spaced similar pattern has been or will be used elsewhere
on the map. Heavy-line patterns or bars are not desirable.
The lines forming a pattern should generally be drawn at an angle of
45&deg; to the sides of the map; they should be drawn vertically or horizontally
only in small areas or in areas not crossed by meridians or
parallels or by other lines running in the same direction. The lines
should preferably run across the long axis of an area, not parallel
to it, and the predominating trend or general direction of the areas
of one geologic formation on a map should decide the direction of
the lines for all areas of that formation on the same map, even if the
rule must be violated on some of the minor areas.</p>

<p>An effort should always be made to produce a pattern that is
subordinate in strength to the main lines of the base map on which
it is drawn. In black and white maps, as in colored maps, unlike
patterns should be placed next to each other. If they are so placed
it may not be necessary to rule the lines on two adjacent areas in
opposite directions to produce needed distinctions. A section liner
or other ruling device should be used in drawing line patterns in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
order to produce uniformly even spacing. The application of six of
these conventional patterns to a base map is shown in <a href="#Figure_9">figure 9</a>.</p>

<p class="caption4">STANDARD COLORS FOR GEOLOGIC MAPS.</p>

<p>The standard series of colors for systems of sedimentary rocks is
shown on the maps in the Survey's geologic folios but is subject to
modifications for use on maps in other Survey reports. Each system
is represented by a different color, and if there are two or more formations
in one system they are generally distinguished by using different
patterns composed of straight parallel lines in the same color. The
patterns for subaerial deposits (chiefly Quaternary) are composed of
dots or circles, or combinations of both, and may be printed in any
color, but the color most often used is yellow or ochraceous orange.
No specific colors are prescribed for igneous rocks, but if only a few
areas are shown red or pink is preferred. The colors used for igneous
rocks are generally more brilliant and purer than those used for sedimentary
rocks. For small areas they are used "solid"; for large areas
they are reduced in tone by the use of a suitable cross-line pattern or
"reticle." Metamorphic rocks are represented by short dashes irregularly
placed. These dashes may be in black or in color over a ground
tint or over an uncolored area, or they may be in white on a ground
tint or pattern. The standard colors used for the sedimentary series
covering the 12 systems recognized by the Geological Survey are:
Quaternary (<span class="x2">Q</span>), ochraceous orange; Tertiary (<span class="x2">T</span>), <i>yellow ocher</i> and
<i>isabella color</i>; Cretaceous (<span class="x2">K</span>), <i>olive-green</i> or <i>rainette-green</i>; Jurassic
(<span class="x2">J</span>), <i>blue-green</i> or <i>niagara-green</i>; Triassic (<img src="images/txt_tria.png" width="19" height="22" alt="TR" title="TR" style="position: relative; top:6px;" />), <i>light peacock-blue</i>
or <i>bluish gray-green</i>; Carboniferous (<span class="x2">C</span>), <i>blue</i> or <i>columibia-blue</i>;
Devonian (<span class="x2">D</span>), <i>gray-purple</i> or <i>heliotrope-gray</i>; Silurian (<span class="x2">S</span>), <i>purple</i>

<p>The following is the simplest and most accurate method of marking
the reduction or enlargement of a map to a selected scale: Measure
the distance between the extreme meridians along one of the
parallels. (See <a href="#Figure_10">fig. 10</a>.) Convert this distance into miles by multiplying
the number of degrees it covers (say 3) by the number of
miles in a degree. A degree on the forty-third parallel, for example,
is 50.669 miles,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which multiplied by 3 equals 152.007 miles. Then
draw a line on the margin of the map, outside the border, the exact
length of the 3 degrees, and just below this line draw another line
representing the same number of miles (152.007) on the scale to
which the map is to be reduced or enlarged. Then mark to reduce or
enlarge the upper line to the lower line, as shown in <a href="#Figure_10">figure 10</a>. A
long line will reduce error and give greater accuracy than a short
one, and therefore as great a distance should be set off as possible.
The number of miles represented by both lines and the fractional
scale to which it is to be reduced should be stated on the drawing,
for permanent record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Maps that will bear reduction without affecting the clearness of
the details they show may be reduced to fit the book in which they
are to appear, regardless of definite scale. The reduction for such
maps is best marked in fractions, as "<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> off," "<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> off," "<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> off." If
the size needed is not exactly represented by these fractions it should
be indicated in inches, as "Reduce this line to 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches," or "Reduce
to 4<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches in width."</p>

<p class="caption2">DIAGRAMS.</p>

<p>In preparing a diagram a draftsman should endeavor to make its
parts and relations perfectly clear to the reader. He should study
the drawing or material furnished by the author until he fully understands
it and should endeavor to reproduce it simply and legibly.
Any lettering that may be needed should generally be in plain
upright or slanting gothic type (see <a href="#Plate_IX">Pl. IX</a>), or it may be in roman.</p>

<p>A diagram should generally be drawn on bristol board or on blue-lined
section paper and should be marked for reduction to the
minimum size. It should bear no title, as the title will be set up in
type by the printer.</p>


<p class="caption2">SECTIONS.</p>

<p>The sections used in geologic reports are of two widely different
kinds. One shows only the broader relations of parts; the other
shows details of structure as well as relations. One is diagrammatic;
the other is more realistic and graphic. The draftsman should prepare
all sections strictly according to the copy supplied by the author
but should use proper symbols and make a more finished drawing.
The various kinds of sections, most of them geologic, are described
on pages <a href="#Page_29">29</a>-<a href="#Page_30">30</a>, and the conventions used to express lithologic character
are shown in <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Detailed drawings of this kind, though entirely conventional, can
be so prepared as to give a satisfactory expression of nature. The
draftsman should study well-prepared sections in Geological Survey
reports and should learn the details of folding and faulting from
textbooks. He should first ascertain whether or not the vertical
scale in the original section has been unduly exaggerated, and if so
he should confer with the author with a view to reducing the exaggeration
as much as possible. He should submit to the author all
questions as to doubtful points, as well as all suggestions for improvement
in expression, before he makes any changes, and he should
make corrections only on the author's approval. A seeming inaccuracy
in an author's drawing may be a faithful representation of
natural conditions. For example, a formation that seems to be
omitted by inadvertence in drawing may really "pinch out" at a
point represented in the section. (See a on <a href="#Figure_11">fig. 11</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p>Penciled lines corresponding to those shown by dots in <a href="#Figure_11">figure 11</a>
should be carefully added in redrawing a roughly sketched section
that shows complex folding. An original indefinite sketch that shows
complicated structure affords opportunities for error in preparing
the new drawing, and omissions may be detected by following the
formations as they would be continued above and below the section,
as shown by the dotted lines in the figure.</p>


<p class="caption2">PLANS AND CROSS SECTIONS OF MINES.</p>

<p>Plans of mines, like diagrams, should not be elaborate, and their
lettering should be plain and legible, yet it should not be so conspicuous
as to obscure other details. Gothic letters should generally
be used, but some plans require different styles of lettering, especially
for geographic or other names that should be coordinate with
those on maps or other illustrations in the book. Unless there are
good reasons, however, for varying the styles of lettering, plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
gothic capitals, or capitals and lower-case letters, either upright or
slanting, should be used. Abbreviations for the numbers of levels
should generally be given thus: 3d level, 6th level, 200-foot level, etc.,
or the shorter terms may be spelled out, as third level, sixth level.
The same general scheme of lettering should be used on all plans and
cross sections that are to appear in one publication or in one series of
similar papers.</p>

<p>The reduction of such drawings to the minimum scale consistent
with clearness is always advisable.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="DRAWINGS_OF_SPECIMENS" id="DRAWINGS_OF_SPECIMENS"></a>
DRAWINGS OF SPECIMENS OF ROCKS AND FOSSILS.</p>


<p class="caption3">METHODS USED.</p>

<p>Drawings of specimens or other objects were once made with
brush and pencil or with pen and ink, by means of measurements
taken with dividers or by viewing the specimen through a camera
lucida. Each of these methods is still used, but by using the camera
lucida in sketching: the outlines and details more accurate proportions
and relations can be produced, whether the object is to be enlarged
or reduced, than by any other means except photography.</p>


<p class="caption3">BRUSH AND PENCIL DRAWINGS.</p>

<p>In all drawings or photographs of specimens, except photomicrographs
of thin sections, the light should appear to come from the
upper left quarter. A disregard of the well-established rule that the
direction of illumination should be uniform throughout a series of
drawings would cause confusion or uncertainty in the interpretation
of the relief shown in them.</p>

<p>Reynolds's three-ply and four-ply bristol board affords a satisfactory
surface for brush and pencil drawings. Its surface is smooth
and hard and, being free from coating of any kind, permits satisfactory
erasures without great injury; its color is pure whits; and it
is durable.</p>

<p>Boss's relief hand-stipple paper is also well adapted to many kinds
of brush drawings as well as to its primary use for producing stippled
effects. Very delicate gradations of color or light and shade can be
produced on its surface with brush and lampblack or with india ink,
and high lights can be made by scraping off the chalky surface.</p>

<p>The draftsman who is preparing brush and pencil drawings
should have first of all a knowledge of the principles of light and
shade, of reflected light, and (for drawing specimens) of shadow
perspective. He should also have delicacy of touch and ability to
see and interpret form and to reproduce the soft blending of light
and shade shown in a good photograph. He should be provided
with pencils equal in quality to the Koh-i-noor B, F, 4H, and 6H;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the best quality of red sable brushes of the sizes of Winsor &amp; Newton's
Nos. 3, 4, and 6; the best quality of stick india ink; a cake or pan of
lampblack; and a porcelain saucer or slab.</p>

<p>In drawings of fossils and of some other specimens a combination
of pencil and brush work produces satisfactory results and tends to
increase speed. The gloss produced by penciling, however, is objectionable
and should be obviated by a preponderance of brush work.
Stick India ink is the best pigment to use in delicate wash drawings,
and lampblack is preferable for large work on which the softer
tones of the shading are not so important and for drawings that are to
be considerably reduced when engraved. Gouache (an opaque mixture
of Chinese white and lampblack) may also be used, but it is best
suited for large work.</p>

<p>In making corrections on brush drawings the parts to be corrected
should be carefully washed out with a small short-cropped brush
and water and still further cleaned by using a rubber eraser over
an erasing shield or an opening cut in a piece of celluloid. Erasures
should not be made on delicate work with a knife or a sand rubber,
as either will injure the surface and affect reproduction. In measuring
a specimen with dividers the draftsman should be careful not
to injure the specimen or to puncture the paper on which he is preparing
the drawing.</p>


<p class="caption3">PEN DRAWINGS.</p>

<p>A draftsman who is preparing drawings of specimens with pen
and ink should have a good assortment of pens equal to Gillott's Nos.
291, 290, and 170, liquid waterproof ink equal to that manufactured
by Higgins, good pencils, hard and soft rubber erasures, plain dividers,
and Reynolds's bristol board. A glass eraser is also useful.</p>

<p>Good pen drawings of specimens are much more difficult to make
than brush drawings. They can be prepared only by a draftsman
who has had some artistic training and experience in pen work. Few
draftsmen can prepare pen drawings that faithfully represent both
the detail and the texture of specimens; the shading on many such
drawings confuses and destroys both detail and texture.</p>

<p>The pencil sketch over which a pen drawing of a specimen should
be made must be prepared in much the same manner as the sketch
for a brush drawing, though the outlines need not be so delicate.
This sketch is generally made on bristol board. The pen work
should begin with the outlines and should then be carried to the details,
and finally to the shading, whether in lines or stipple. The
texture of a specimen is the best key to the proper shading. If the
specimen is decidedly granular, stippling is appropriate; if it is
smooth or polished, finely drawn parallel lines, varied in spacing and
character according to depth of shade and texture, are preferable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Erasures can be made with a hard-rubber eraser, other parts being
protected by a shield, or with a very sharp knife or a glass eraser, and
the parts erased can be resurfaced with an agate burnisher.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="RETOUCHING_PHOTOGRAPHS_OF_SPECIMENS" id="RETOUCHING_PHOTOGRAPHS_OF_SPECIMENS"></a>RETOUCHING PHOTOGRAPHS OF SPECIMENS.</p>


<p>Photographs of specimens, particularly fossils that have been
coated to destroy local color, should be printed on velox paper, in
a tone somewhat lighter than that of ordinary photographs. The details
and relief should, however, be strong enough to enable the
draftsman to see them clearly, so that by retouching them and
strengthening the shadows and high lights he can make them sufficiently
strong for reproduction. This he can do by a combination of
pencil and brush work, the pencil being used sparingly because the
gloss produced by the graphite is likely to affect reproduction. A
No. 3 Winsor &amp; Newton's red sable brush and lampblack are preferable
for the greater part of this work, and a 4H and a 6H pencil for the
fine details and as a possible aid in producing the finer gradations
of shading. The details should be retouched or strengthened under a
reading glass to insure accuracy; the broader effects can be best produced
without the aid of a magnifier.</p>

<p>Erasures on photographs of specimens should be made very carefully
with a hard rubber that is free from sand, and the parts not to
be disturbed should be protected with a shield. High lights may be
added by carefully scraping or rubbing the surface of the paper.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="LANDSCAPE_DRAWINGS_FROM_POOR_PHOTOGRAPHS" id="LANDSCAPE_DRAWINGS_FROM_POOR_PHOTOGRAPHS"></a>LANDSCAPE DRAWINGS FROM POOR PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>


<p>A poor photograph or one that has become injured and can not
be retouched for direct reproduction can be utilized by making from
it, as described below, a pen drawing or a brush or crayon drawing,
which will be almost photographically correct.</p>


<p class="caption3">PEN DRAWINGS MADE OVER PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>

<p>A pen and ink drawing may be made over a blue print or a bromide
print (preferably a blue print) and the photographic image then
bleached out. The blue print should be larger than publication size
and should not be so dark that the draftsman can not see his lines.
If the negative is available a bromide enlargement can be obtained;
otherwise the picture should be rephotographed in larger size, preferably
twice publication size. The enlargement will give the draftsman
greater freedom in drawing details and will make his work appear
finer and better in the reduced illustration. If the photographic
print is of a subject requiring the use of instruments it should be
securely fastened to a drawing board, square with the board, so that
any horizontal and vertical lines in it may be ruled by the use of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<b>T</b> square and triangle. For specimen or landscape work it need not
be fastened.</p>

<p>For bleaching blue prints a saturated solution of oxalate of potassium
(K<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O) has been used with good results. For bleaching
bromide prints cyanide of potassium (KCN) to which a few
drops or flakes of iodine have been added should be used. Neither
kind of print should be bleached until the drawing has been completely
finished in every detail, because bleaching loosens the fibers
of the paper, so that the ink of any added lines is likely to spread.
The print should be placed in a hard-rubber pan, the bleaching solution
poured on it, and the pan rocked until the image disappears.
The print should then be carefully removed, thoroughly washed in
running water, placed between clean white blotters to dry, and
finally mounted on cardboard. For temporary, hurried work on
drawings that are not to be retained for future use the blue print may
be mounted first and bleached by pouring the bleaching fluid over the
mounted print.</p>


<p class="caption3">BRUSH DRAWINGS FROM POOR PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>

<p>Brush drawings may be made directly from photographs by working
over an enlarged print with gouache, or by making a pencil
tracing and sketch of the photograph and working it up with lampblack
or india ink. The photograph should be larger than publication
size to permit greater freedom and breadth in drawing details.
The larger size will also afford a more refined and better engraving
when reduced. If lampblack or india ink is used and the subject is
small, bristol board is recommended, but if the photograph is larger
than, say, 8 by 10 inches, Whatman's hot-pressed double elephant or
similar paper, laid down with thumb tacks, will prove satisfactory.</p>

<p>If gouache is used over a print a preliminary drawing is of course
unnecessary, but the photograph should be an unglazed print of
a size that will require considerable reduction, and the finished drawing
should be protected by an oversheet. If lampblack or india ink
and not gouache is used the photograph should be traced and a fairly
complete pencil sketch should be made before the brush is used.</p>

<p>Plates I, IV, <i>A</i>, V, <i>B</i>, and VII, <i>B</i>, Monograph 34, were made from
gouache drawings. Plates III, <i>A</i>, VII, <i>A</i>, X, XI, XII, XIII, XX,
XXVIII, and XXX, in the same publication, were made from lampblack
or india-ink wash drawings. The originals can be examined
at any time.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="OUTDOOR_SKETCHES" id="OUTDOOR_SKETCHES"></a>OUTDOOR SKETCHES.</p>


<p>The art of sketching from nature is one in which few but professional
artists excel. Not many geologists are able to make sketches
from nature that are suitable for direct reproduction. An artistic
draftsman should be able to redraw the geologist's sketches, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in their true perspective and relations, with the skill necessary to
make them satisfactory illustrations.</p>

<p>In most crude outdoor sketches the important features are usually
shown with sufficient clearness to follow. If they are not the draftsman
should ascertain what those features are and prepare the new
drawing in such a way as to display them properly. The new drawing
should be made with pen and ink, generally for reduction to a
text figure, which is the most appropriate form for such an illustration.</p>

<p>In all sketches of this kind the lines should be drawn in such a
way as to produce natural effects and at the same time to make good
printing plates. Good examples of pen and ink sketches of this
class can be found in Monograph 34, already referred to, and in the
Seventh Annual Report, especially Plates XXVIII and XXXVIII;
Ninth Annual Report, Plates XLIII and XLIV; Tenth Annual Report,
Plates XIV and XIX and figure 58; Eleventh Annual Report,
Plates XV, XXVII, XXXV, LII, and LIV and figures 18, 30, 31, 67,
98, and 99.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="DRAWINGS_OF_CRYSTALS" id="DRAWINGS_OF_CRYSTALS"></a>DRAWINGS OF CRYSTALS.</p>


<p>A crystal should generally be drawn in outline with straight lines.
The invisible rear side of a crystal, if shown, should be represented by
dashed lines. The outer boundary line of a crystal should be slightly
heavier than the inside lines, which should all be of the same weight.
Striations should be shown by straight lines; broken or uneven surfaces
by irregular lines. A twinning line, if an intersection edge,
should be solid; if not an intersection edge it should be broken into
dashes. Italic, Greek, German, and Old English letters are used to
mark crystal faces. All faces of a given form should be marked by
the same letter but may be differentiated, if necessary, by primes or
numerals, thus: m, m&#8242;, m&#8243;, m&#8244;, m<sup><i>IV</i></sup>. "Leaders" should be short
full lines, or, if these are likely to be confusing, they should be dashes.
Numbers may be used in place of letters for specific purposes. Letters
indicating twin faces are underscored; a second twin is doubly
underscored or overscored, thus: <span class="undrln">m</span>, <span class="dundrln">m</span>, <span class="ovrln">m</span>. Twin units may be differentiated
by the use of roman numerals.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="RETOUCHING_PHOTOGRAPHS" id="RETOUCHING_PHOTOGRAPHS"></a>RETOUCHING PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>


<p>An author, of course, selects his photographs to illustrate some
special features; he does not always consider their fitness for reproduction.
Photographs that are blurred or out of focus, those in
which the shadows are too black or lack transparency, and those
which have local defects, such as bad skies or spots, must be worked
over to make them suitable for reproduction. In order to remedy
these defects and produce natural results the draftsman doing work
of this sort should be able to see and interpret nature properly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to supply natural effects in a manner corresponding with those produced
photographically. He should be sufficiently expert with the
brush and pencil and in handling an air brush to duplicate the delicate
and soft tones in the photograph, and he should know how the pigments
he uses will "take" when the subject is reproduced.</p>

<p>The retoucher should have access to an air brush and should provide
himself with a jar of photo white or blanc d'argent and a color
box containing indian red, crimson lake, yellow ocher, lampblack, and
ultramarine&mdash;colors with which he can duplicate those shown in any
photograph. He should also have the best grade of red sable brushes,
ranging in size from No. 3 to No. 8, a stack of porcelain saucers, and
a jar of oxgall. By mixing the colors to match exactly the shades
of a photograph and using a red sable brush he can strengthen details,
"spot out" flaws, and remove imperfections, except those in
skies or other large, flat areas, for which he must use an air brush.</p>

<p>The air brush has become a necessary adjunct to a retoucher's outfit.
Smooth, even gradations of flat tones can not be successfully
applied to photographs without it, and it is therefore indispensable,
especially for retouching skies and covering other large areas.</p>

<p>Before retouching a photograph the draftsman should mix in a
saucer a tint that will match the color of the part that is to be retouched
and should try this tint and note its effect after it has dried
and change it, if necessary, until it matches the color exactly. If he
is to retouch a number of photographs that have the same local color
he may with advantage make up enough of the tint for the entire
lot, thoroughly mixing it and seeing that it is not too thin. In making
this tint he should use only pigments of the best grade, and if
he finds that the Chinese or other white he is using does not photograph
well, or that it does not hold its color, he should discard
it at once and use another brand. Photographs that are to be retouched
should be large enough to permit sufficient reduction to
soften the effects of retouching.</p>

<p>In order to eliminate the lines of junction between two or more
photographs that are joined together to form a panorama some adjustment
or fitting of details by retouching is generally required
before the group is rephotographed to obtain a new print of the whole
on one piece of paper. As it is often desirable to increase the width
of such an illustration the photographer should be instructed to print
the photograph on a strip of paper that is wider than the negative, so
that, if necessary, the retouching may be carried above or below the
new print to add depth to the illustration.</p>

<p>Panoramas may also be drawn from photographs with either pen
or brush in the manner described on pages 68-69.</p>

PART III. PROCESSES OF REPRODUCING ILLUSTRATIONS.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="METHODS_EMPLOYED" id="METHODS_EMPLOYED"></a>METHODS EMPLOYED.</p>


<p>The preliminary work in producing illustrations includes the
preparation, from originals submitted by authors, of drawings and
other kinds of "copy" in such a way that the copy can be reproduced
in multiple by printing.</p>

<p>Several processes are used for preparing plates for printing illustrations,
and each has its peculiar features of excellence. One process
may render fine details with facility but may fail in uniformity
in large editions; another may be cheap and effective on the whole
but may not reproduce fine details; and still another may give fine
color or tone effects but may be too expensive. Therefore a knowledge
of the varied uses and results and of the cost of the several
processes of reproduction and, on the other hand, of the kinds of
originals that are best suited for reproduction by any one of the
processes is essential to effectiveness and economy in planning, preparing,
and reproducing an illustration.</p>

<p>The following condensed descriptions of processes are intended
mainly to aid in determining the kind of copy that is appropriate
for each process and the kind and quality of reproduction to be expected,
so that only the principal operations or stages in each process
are described. Wood engraving, which was used in making printing
plates for many of the illustrations in the early publications of the
Geological Survey, is described here only to compare that laborious
and "indirect" method of engraving cuts with the more modern
kinds of relief engraving. In 1892 it gave way to photo-engraving.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="PHOTO-ENGRAVING" id="PHOTO-ENGRAVING"></a>PHOTO-ENGRAVING.</p>


<p class="caption3">GENERAL FEATURES</p>

<p>The term "photo-engraving" is applied to processes by which a
black and white line drawing, photograph, or like original is reproduced
in relief on a metal plate from which prints may be made on
an ordinary printing press, in distinction from processes that print
from flat or relatively flat surfaces, such as the lithographic and
photogelatin processes. The photo-engraving processes that are most
generally used are those called "zinc etching" and "half-tone engraving."
These processes depend on the discovery that gelatin or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
similar organic material, if treated with potassium or ammonium
bichromate and exposed to the action of light, is made insoluble in
water. If a metal plate coated with bichromatized gelatin or albumen
is exposed to light under a negative the parts acted upon by
light become insoluble and those not acted upon remain unchanged
and may be washed away so as to expose the metal, which is then
etched with acid in order to give relief to the unexposed parts and
make of them a printing surface.</p>


<p class="caption3">ZINC ETCHING.</p>

<p>Zinc etching is adapted to the direct reproduction of a pen and
ink drawing composed of lines, dots, or solid black areas. On the
finished metal plate these lines, dots, and solid areas form the printing
surface, and the spaces between them, which have been etched
away, represent the white or blank parts of the picture. The process
is cheap and is almost universally used for reproducing small drawings
designed for text illustrations. It is also well adapted to the
reproduction of maps and diagrams measuring in print not more
than about 10 by 14 inches. One of the chief advantages of this and
of all other direct (photographic) processes of engraving is that
they reproduce a drawing in facsimile, whereas the "personal equation"
must enter into all engravings made by an indirect method&mdash;that
is, by hand&mdash;such as wood engraving, wax engraving, and engraving
on stone or copper, which make it necessary to compare
every detail of the proof with every detail of the drawing before
the engraving can be approved. The pen drawing to be reproduced,
which should preferably be considerably larger than the completed
engraving, is first photographed to the proper size or scale on an
ordinary negative film. The film is then stripped from the negative
and reversed in order that the etched plate may print the design as
in the original and that the film may be grouped with other films on
one large glass and all printed at the same time. The negative
(whether a single film or several) is then placed in a specially constructed
printing frame in contact under pressure with a sensitized
zinc plate and exposed to light.</p>

<p>After the zinc plate has been removed from the printing frame
(in the dark room) the plate is rolled with printer's transfer ink,
which resists acid, and placed in a shallow tray containing water, in
which it is rocked for several minutes, and then taken out and rubbed
gently with cotton. The parts of the coating of the plate that were
acted on by light have become insoluble and will therefore be unaffected
by the water, but the parts of the coating not acted on by
light and therefore not hardened will be removed by the washing,
which will expose the metal and leave the parts acted on by light&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
picture&mdash;in black lines, dots, etc. The plate is then dusted with
"topping powder," a resinous substance which adheres only to the
parts carrying the ink. The plate is then heated so that the resin
and the ink that remain fuse together and form, when cooled, a
resistant surface which will not be affected by the acid to be used
later in etching the unprotected parts of the plate.</p>

<p>The plate is now ready for a preliminary etching in a fluid consisting
of water and a few drops of nitric acid. It is placed in a tray,
rocked gently for a short time, and then removed, washed well in
running water, drained, and dried with gentle heat. "Dragon's
blood," a resinous powder that resists the action of acid, is next
applied to the plate, in order to protect the sides of the lines and the
dots from the acid, and the plate is then heated just sufficiently to
melt the powder and units it with the ink. A small quantity of
nitric acid is now added to the etching bath, and the plate is subjected
to its first thorough biting or etching. It is then removed
from the bath, washed under a tap, carefully wiped with a damp rag,
and dried with gentle heat.</p>

<p>The plate is thus treated three or more times until it is etched deep
enough to insure satisfactory printing, and it is then ready for
finishing, which consists of deepening the larger open spaces between
the lines with a routing machine and of cutting away with hand
gravers lines that are improperly connected or that are so close
together that they will not print separately. The routing machine
is provided with a cutting tool mounted on a revolving spindle that
projects downward into the engraved plate, which is securely
fastened. The movement of the arm that holds the cutter is universal
and can be controlled with great precision. The plate is then
"proved" that is, a proof is taken from it on paper and if the
proof is satisfactory the plate is nailed to a block of wood on which it
will be "type high" (0.918 inch), for printing.</p>

<p>Most drawings for zinc etching are made with a pen in black
ink and consist of lines, dots, or masses of black, but drawings may
also be prepared by using some medium that will produce a fine
stipple, such as a black crayon on rough paper or Ross's stipple paper.
(See <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>.) The drawing should be one and one-half to two or
three times as large as the printed illustration, for it is impossible
to obtain a satisfactory reproduction of a pen and ink drawing without
some reduction. If the drawing has not been reduced the lines
appear heavier in the reproduction than in the drawing, and imperfections
thus become more noticeable; if it has been properly reduced,
imperfections are diminished and the lines and dots become thinner
and finer than those in the drawing. In making a drawing that is to
be reduced the draftsman can also space his lines farther apart and
work out his details more easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>An author should carefully examine and approve the finished
drawings, which can, of course, be greatly altered, if necessary,
before they are engraved; but similar corrections can not be made on
proof sheets of zinc cuts, which should not be marked for alterations
except by eliminating parts. Minor changes can be made in such
a cut by an expert "finisher," but if the cut is small it is generally
cheaper to correct the drawing and have a new cut made.</p>

<p>Zinc etchings cost about 10 to 25 cents a square inch, the cost being
varied according to a standard scale which is based upon the ascertained
cost of reproduction. The minimum charge for a single cut
is $2.</p>


<p class="caption3">COPPER ETCHING IN RELIEF.</p>

<p>Copper etching, which produces a line cut in relief, requires the
same kind of copy that is most often marked for zinc etching and is
used to obtain deeper etching and a more permanent cut. It is said
to produce better printing plates than those etched on zinc and is
used largely for reproducing script lettering and other fine work.
As copper plates will hold up longer in printing than zinc, a cut
etched on copper may not need to be electrotyped.</p>

<p>The chemical part of the process is practically the same as that
employed for etching half-tone plates, described under the next
heading.</p>

<p>The cost of etching on copper is considerably greater than the cost
of etching on zinc. This process is not often used in reproducing
illustrations for publications of the Geological Survey.</p>


<p class="caption3">HALF-TONE ENGRAVING.</p>

<p>The half-tone process is, in name at least, familiar to almost everyone
who has had any connection with the making of books, whether
as author, editor, illustrator, or printer. The invention of a photomechanical
process of reproducing a line drawing to make a metal
plate that could be printed along with type on an ordinary printing
press naturally led to attempts to reproduce similarly a photograph.
It was known that the intermediate shades between white and black
in a photograph&mdash;the half tones&mdash;can be reproduced on an ordinary
printing press only by breaking them up into dots or lines that will
form a good printing surface and that by their variation in size or
density will give for each shade the effect of a uniform tone. In
the half-tone process this effect is produced by photographing the
picture or object through a screen.</p>

<p>The half-tone screen consists of two plates of glass, on each of
which lines running generally at an angle of 45&deg; to the sides of the
plate have been engraved, cemented together so that the lines cross
at right angles. The lines, which are minute grooves filled with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
opaque black pigment, thus appear as a series of black crossed lines
on a white ground. The screen is placed in the camera in front of
the negative. Screens are made that show from 60 lines to an inch
for the coarser newspaper illustrations to 250 lines or more to the
inch for fine book work. The screens used for magazine illustrations
generally show 120 to 150 lines. Those used for Survey publications
show 150 to 175 lines, and for reproducing delicate drawings and
photographs of fossils screens bearing 200 lines to the inch are sometimes
specified; but these finer screens require the use of highly super-coated
papers, some of them made of cheap fiber and not known to
be permanent. For a half tone that is to be printed in the text a
100-line or a 120-line screen is specified.
(See <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. VI, p. 56.</a>)</p>

<p>The method of etching a half-tone plate does not differ greatly
from that used in zinc etching, and there are several kinds of half-tone
plates, though most of them are etched on copper, not on zinc,
those etched on zinc being used principally for newspaper illustrations.
The half-tone screen is used also in other processes to obtain
a negative.</p>

<p>When a half-tone negative hag been made the film is stripped from
the glass plate and reversed, as in the zinc-etching process, though
some half-tone engravers use a mirror box or prism by which the picture
is so disposed on the negative that it does not need stripping and
reversing. A perfectly flat, clean, and highly polished copper plate,
generally large enough to accommodate several such films, is then
coated with a sensitive film according to one of several formulas, all
based on the fact that gelatin or some similar body, if sensitized with
certain chromic salts, becomes hardened and insoluble in water on
exposure to light. This plate is then placed in the printing frame in
contact, under pressure, with the glass negative plate and is exposed
to light in the usual manner. The copper plate is then removed from
the frame in the dark room and made ready for etching.</p>

<p>For etching half-tone plates on copper a saturated solution of perchloride
of iron is used instead of the solution of nitric acid used for
zinc etching. The time of etching ranges from about 5 to 15 minutes,
according to the strength of the solution. One etching is generally
sufficient, but it may be necessary to give the plate another "biting"
if it has not been etched deep enough, or to re-etch it in order to
strengthen contrasts. If, for instance, the sky in a half-tone plate
shows too dark or is uneven in tint it can be made lighter or more
even by re-etching. On the other hand, if certain features on a
plate are too light they can be darkened by burnishing&mdash;rubbing
the surface with a highly polished steel burnisher under just
sufficient pressure to flatten slightly the fine points that form the
printing surface of the plate. When the plate leaves the hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the etcher it is turned over to the finisher, who with a graver removes
spots or any other imperfections that may appear on it. Sometimes
a roulette is used to lighten parts, and other tools are used for
special purposes.</p>

<p>After a plate that shows two or more pictures has been etched and
finished it is divided by sawing them apart. Each one is then put
into a beveling machine, where its edges are trimmed and the usual
border is made, if it is desired. The separate plates are then ready
to be proved and mounted on blocks of wood which make them type
high, ready for printing.</p>

<p>The half-tone process is used almost exclusively for reproducing
photographs and wash drawings, though it will produce a facsimile
of any kind of copy, such as impressions from type, old manuscripts,
or typewriting, but a shade composed of minute black dots will appear
over the entire print and there will be no absolutely whits
areas unless they are produced by routing the plate or cutting out
the high lights. (See <a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a>.) The reproduction of an ordinary outdoor
photograph requires very little handwork, except for re-etching,
burnishing, and cutting the borders. In the reproduction of copy
that is made up of separate parts, such as groups of photographs of
specimens that are to appear on a white ground, the half-tone
"tint"&mdash;or more properly shade&mdash;between and around the several
figures must be removed and numbers must be added. This operation
requires two negatives&mdash;one half tone and one line&mdash;and produces
what is called a "combination" plate. Therefore the difference in the
cost of making a half-tone cut from a single photograph of a landscape
and from a cut made from "copy" of the same size consisting
of a number of small photographs or drawings, to which numbers
or letters are added, is considerable (about 50 per cent greater) and
depends upon the amount of additional work involved. Routing,
when needed, must be done with extreme care lest the edges of a
figure be marred, and this work requires skill that can be gained
only by experience.</p>

<p>Copy for the half-tone process should be as nearly perfect as possible.
Only the best photographs should be selected. Prints on
semimat velox and glossy haloid papers are regarded as the best
photographic copy for reproduction. Every part of the photograph
or drawing should be absolutely clean. If any part that should be
pure white becomes soiled or stained the defects will be reproduced.
If a photograph needs retouching it should be retouched with great
care and just sufficiently to correct defects and to bring out or
strengthen the important details. In many photographs the skies
may be "muddy" or uneven in tone, and this defect can be corrected
by the use of an air brush, the only medium that will produce an
almost even tone. As already stated, half-tone plates can be improved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
by re-etching and tooling, but tooling tends to destroy the
effects of nature and produces an artificial appearance in the print.
One who is preparing wash drawings for reproduction by the half-tone
process should remember that brush marks and other inequalities
of tone will be reproduced with as much fidelity as other details.
Such drawings should therefore be made two or three times larger
than the engraved cut in order to subdue all unnatural effects and to
soften the general tones.</p>

<p>Line drawings are not generally suitable copy for the half-tone
process, but it is occasionally desirable to use that process instead of
zinc etching for reproducing a line drawing that has been inexpertly
prepared if the cost of redrawing would more than offset the difference
in cost between zinc etching and the more expensive half-tone
process. In reproducing a pen drawing by half tone the lines
become softened and represent the details and shading only; but the
pen drawing may be further developed by brush work. Examples
of this type of reproduction are Plates V, <i>A</i>, VI, <i>A</i>, and XV, figure
10, and other illustrations in Survey Monograph 34.</p>

<p>Vignetting, which consists of a skillful grading off of the edges of
a picture, as well as extensive tooling or hand engraving, is often
employed for artistic effect but should be specified only for exceptional
illustrations. The plates made for the Survey are either
"square trimmed" or the ground tint is entirely omitted or routed
away; they are not usually tooled or vignetted.</p>

<p>Half-tone cuts etched on copper cost 20 to 60 cents a square inch,
the cost being varied according to a standard scale based on the
ascertained cost of reproduction. Those that require a screen finer
than 150 lines cost 25 per cent additional. The minimum charge for
a single cut is $3.</p>

<p>Half tones etched on zinc (100-line screen or coarser) cost 25 per
cent less than those etched on copper.</p>


<p class="caption3">THREE-COLOR HALF-TONE PROCESS.</p>

<p>The three-color process is practically an adaptation of the half-tone
process to color printing based on the theory that all colors or
hues in nature can be reproduced by combinations of three colors of
the spectrum&mdash;red, blue, and yellow. The process differs from the
ordinary half-tone process particularly in the use of color filters in
making the negatives and in the character of screens and diaphragms
used. This process, like all others, is worked somewhat differently
in different establishments. In what is called the indirect method,
the one most commonly used, twelve photographic operations are
necessary to produce one illustration, or the three plates or cuts from
which one illustration is to be reproduced by printing. These twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
operations produce three chromatic negatives, each representing one
color; three transparencies or positives, made from the chromatic
negatives; three half-tone negatives, made from the positives; and
finally three contact prints, made on sensitized metal plates. In
what is called the direct method the half-tone screen is placed in
front of the photographic plate so that it becomes also a half-tone
negative from which a print is made on a sensitized metal plate.
Thus the photographic operations in the direct method are reduced
to six, but the interference to the passage of light offered by the
half-tone screen and by the prism used to reverse the image on the
negative lengthens the time of exposure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no pigments have been found that can reproduce
in purity the colors of the spectrum, and to this fact is due the
failure of the process to reproduce exactly all the colors, tints, and
shades of an original. When a drawing in black on white paper
is photographed only the white paper affects the negative film. The
transparent parts of the developed negative thus represent the black,
and the opaque parts, which have been acted upon by light, represent
the whits. Theoretically, when a chromatic negative is made for
the yellow plate a purple-violet filter cuts out all the yellow and
allows the red and blue rays to affect the plate; when a negative is
made for the blue plate an orange filter similarly cuts out the blue and
allows the yellow and red rays to affect the plate; and when a negative
is made for the red plate a green filter cuts out the red and
permits the blue and yellow rays to affect the plate. These color
filters, which are usually made of transparent stained gelatin, are
generally placed in front of the lens. When printing plates like
those used in the half-tone process have been made from the three
negatives and the plates have been inked with yellow, blue, and red
ink, respectively, a combined impression from them will produce a
close approximation of the subject photographed. The colored inks
often used are light yellow, peacock or prussian blue, and bright,
transparent crimson.</p>

<p>The ordinary half-tone screen, which bears lines cut at an angle of
45&deg; to the sides of the plate, is rectangular, but the screens used
for three-color work are made circular in order that they may be
turned in the camera to make the lines intersect at other angles, the
angles being varied to avoid producing an undesirable pattern or a
moire effect. Turning the screen also prevents the exact coincidence
or superposition of the red, blue, and yellow dots, which would produce
black. In other respects the screens do not differ essentially
from those used in ordinary half-tone work.</p>

<p>As special experience is necessary in printing three-color plates the
engraver generally delivers the printed illustrations to the purchaser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
instead of the plates, which he furnishes for other kinds of relief
printing.</p>

<p>The copy for this process may consist of anything in color, such as
specimens, objects, paintings, or properly colored photographs. The
process does not usually reproduce all the colors and tints of an
original with equal exactness and is not used by the Survey for work
that demands precise reproduction of color, but it is satisfactory for
reproducing most colored drawings, colored photographs of specimens,
or the specimens themselves if they show individual variations
in color. As the process is entirely photomechanical it gives more
scientific accuracy in detail than chromolithography, in which there
is much hand work, and it is much less expensive. If the colors
shown in proofs are not satisfactory they can be modified.</p>

<p>The four-color process, in which four color plates are used, gives
a closer approximation of true color values than the three-color process,
and at a comparatively small increase of cost. The additional
color used is generally a neutral gray or black.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="WAX_ENGRAVING_THE_CEROTYPE_PROCESS" id="WAX_ENGRAVING_THE_CEROTYPE_PROCESS"></a>WAX ENGRAVING (THE CEROTYPE PROCESS).</p>


<p>The wax or cerotype process does not require finished drawings
and is especially suitable for making text illustrations and small
maps, although it may be used also for large work. For this process
blue prints, pencil sketches, old prints, or rough copy of any kind
may be submitted&mdash;that is, it is not necessary to furnish carefully
prepared drawings in black ink, as it would be for photo-engraving,
for the wax engraver will reproduce in proper form any illustration
in which the copy and the instructions show what is wanted, just as
an experienced draftsman will make a good drawing from the rough
original furnished by an author. Full and clear instructions should
always be given, however, as to the size of the cut wanted and what
it is to show.</p>

<p>In this process a polished copper plate is coated with a film consisting
of beeswax, a whitening medium, and other ingredients, and
the coating, which varies in thickness according to the nature of the
copy, is sensitized as in the ordinary photographic processes. The
map or other design to be engraved is first photographed to publication
size and a contact print is made on the wax coating from the
negative. The lines and other parts of the photographed image are
then traced or cut through the wax to the copper plate with steel
tools and straightened or perfected by the engraver, but the lettering
is set in printer's type, which is pressed into the wax until it also
touches the metal plate. After the work of cutting through the wax
has been completed the larger open spaces between the lines are
"built up" by the addition of wax to give greater depth to the plate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
so that the wax plate thus built up corresponds to an electrotype
mold. The plate is then dusted with powdered graphite and suspended
in a solution containing copper, where by electrolytic action a
copper shell is formed over its surface. When this shell is sufficiently
thick it is removed from the solution and reinforced on the back
with metal, and proofs are taken from it. If the proofs are satisfactory
the plate is blocked type-high.</p>

<p>Wax-engraved plates may be used for printing colored maps or
diagrams, in which variations of tint are produced by various kinds
of machine rulings. The effect of some of the colors thus produced
is almost a "flat" tint, in which a pattern can be detected only by
close scrutiny. Some color work is printed from a wax base plate in
combination with half-tone color plates.</p>

<p>The price of a wax engraving depends entirely on the size of
the cut, the amount of work involved, and the character of the original
copy, but it should not exceed very much the cost of a carefully
prepared pen drawing plus the cost of a zinc etching made from it.
Cuts engraved by the wax process, like zinc and half-tone plates,
are delivered to the purchaser. If colored work is ordered, however,
the printed sheets, not the cuts, are delivered.</p>




<p class="caption2">WOOD ENGRAVING.</p>


<p>Wood engraving was once the universal method of producing cuts
for illustrations that were designed to be printed on an ordinary
press. It is said to be the oldest of all methods of engraving illustrations.
The engraving is made on a block of boxwood, a very dense,
hard wood of a light-yellow color. The block is cut type-high across
the grain, and the engraving surface is made perfectly smooth by
nibbing it with pumice or other stone. When a cut is to be larger
than 3 or 4 inches square the wood block is made up of pieces securely
dovetailed or joined together to prevent splitting and warping. A
woodcut is not used for printing but is electrotyped and the electrotype
is used in the press.</p>

<p>Originally the smoothed surface of the wood block was coated with
prepared chalk or Chinese whits, and on this coating a finished drawing
was made with a brush and pencil by an illustrator. According
to more recent practice the surface of the wood is covered with a
sensitized coating, on which the drawing or design to be engraved
is photographed. The engraver then, with various kinds of gravers
and other tools, cuts out the parts of the picture that are to be
represented by white paper and leaves the lines, dots, and black areas
as a printing surface, thus translating the shades and tints of the picture
into a system of lines and dots which exactly duplicate, in effect,
the details and tones of the original design. In order to produce a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
line effect of an area in which the tone is intermediate between whits
and black the engraver must space his lines so that one-half the area
will remain as printing surface and the other half as white spaces,
and he must give character and direction to his lines, so that, if he
is skillful, he can reproduce not only the delicate tones but the
texture and details of the original picture. Many wood engravers
became noted for their artistic rendering of magazine illustrations,
of famous paintings, and of other works of art.</p>

<p>The Survey began to abandon this method of engraving in 1884,
when the Sixth Annual Report was in press, substituting for it the
cheaper photomechanical processes, zinc etching and half-tone engraving,
and entirely abandoned its use in 1892.</p>

<p>Many good examples of wood engraving may be found in the early
monographs and annual reports of the Geological Survey. Monograph
2 contains numerous examples.</p>




<p class="caption2">PHOTOGELATIN PROCESSES.</p>


<p>Bichromatized gelatin is used in several photomechanical processes
of reproducing illustrations, but in the photogelatin processes the
gelatin not only receives the image by exposure to light through a
negative but becomes a printing surface on a plate from which prints
are made somewhat as in lithography. The several photogelatin
processes are much the same as the original collotype process and
are best known by the names collotype, heliotype, albertype, artotype,
and the German name lichtdruck.</p>

<p>In working these processes a thick plate of glass, after certain preliminary
treatment, is coated with sensitized gelatin. The plate is
then placed in a drying room or oven having a temperature of 120&deg; F.,
baked until it is thoroughly dry, and allowed to cool gradually.
The subject to be reproduced is then photographed in the usual
manner, and unless a prism or mirror box has been used the negative
is stripped and reversed in order to make the print reproduce
the original in proper position. From the negative a contact print
is made on the gelatin-coated plate, the parts or molecules of gelatin
being hardened in proportion to the amount of light that affects them.
After the contact print has been made the gelatin plate is thoroughly
washed in cold water, in order to dissolve and wash out the bichromate
and stop any further action of light on the plate, and is then
thoroughly dried. Before prints are made from the gelatin-coated
plate water is flowed on it and penetrates different parts of the gelatin
according to their hardness. The darkest parts of the picture will
correspond to the hardest and densest parts of the gelatin, which will
not absorb water; the lighter parts will take up more water. The
surface water is then removed with a rubber straight edge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and an absorbent roller and the plate is ready for inking. The ink,
being greasy, has no affinity for water, and when it is rolled over the
plate it adheres only to the dry parts of the gelatin, and in the press
is carried to the paper in all the lights and shades of the illustration.
The plate is kept moist in printing.</p>

<p>The paper used for printing from photogelatin plates must be
free from chemicals that will affect the gelatin. A nearly pure rag
paper is generally used.</p>

<p>The photogelatin process is well adapted to the reproduction of
paleontologic drawings, wash drawings, photographs, photomicrographs,
works of art, old manuscripts&mdash;in fact, any kind of subject
in which the reproduction of delicate lights and shades is essential.
If properly manipulated it has distinct advantages over the half-tone
process in that it can reproduce details and light and shade
without showing the effect of a screen and without the use of coated
paper. Excellent reproductions by the heliotype process are also
made in color by first printing the design in a neutral tone and superposing
appropriate transparent colors on this print, somewhat as in
chromolithography, so that the colors softly blend with the shaded
groundwork.</p>

<p>Reproductions made by the photogelatin process are more expensive
than those made by the half-tone process, for the prints are
generally made on better paper and are printed with greater care.
They give no screen effect and are perhaps unrivaled by prints
obtained by any other process except photogravure, in which the
image is printed from a metal plate that has been sensitized, exposed
under a reversed negative, and etched.</p>

<p>Changes can not be made on photogelatin plates except by making
over the corrected parts. All retouching must be done on the originals
or on the negatives made from then.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="LITHOGRAPHY" id="LITHOGRAPHY"></a>LITHOGRAPHY.</p>


<p class="caption3">ORIGINAL PROCESS.</p>

<p>The general term "lithography" is sometimes used to indicate
not only the original process so named, said to have been invented
by Senefelder, but chromolithography, photolithography, and engraving
on stone, as well as engraving on copper as a means of supplying
matter to be transferred to and printed from a lithographic
stone.</p>

<p>Senefelder discovered that limestone will absorb either grease or
Water, and that neither one will penetrate a part of the surface previously
affected by the other. He found that if a design is drawn
on limestone with a greasy crayon and the stone afterward properly
prepared with a solution of nitric acid and gum, greasy ink will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
adhere only to the parts that are covered with the crayon, and that
the stone will give off an impression of the design.</p>

<p>Lithographic stone is described as a fine, compact, homogeneous
limestone, which may be either a pure carbonate of lime or dolomitic&mdash;that
is, it may contain magnesium. Although limestone is one of
the most common rocks, limestone of a quality suitable for use in
lithography is found at only a few localities.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> There are two general
classes of lithographic stone, known to the trade as "blue" or hard
stone and "yellow" or soft stone. The blue stone is adapted for
engraving and to the better grade of fine-line printing; the yellow
stone is rated as somewhat inferior.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Kubel, S. J., Lithographic stone: U. S. Geol. Survey Mineral Resources, 1900, pp.
869-873, 1901.</p></div>

<p>In the original process, which may here be termed plain lithography,
two methods are employed in putting on stone the design to
be reproduced. In one the subject or picture to be reproduced is
drawn on the printing stone either with a lithographic crayon or
with a pen dipped in lithographic ink or "tusche," which is oily
or fatty, like the crayon. In the other method the drawing is made
on transfer paper and transferred to the stone. In drawing on
stone it is necessary to reverse the design, so that all lettering must
be drawn backward. In doing this the artist often uses a mirror
to aid him. If the drawing is made on transfer paper the design
and the lettering are copied as in the original&mdash;not reversed.</p>

<p>Before a drawing is made on stone a stone of the quality suited
to the particular design in hand is selected. The stone is then
ground and polished, and if the drawing is to be made with crayon
it is "grained" according to the special requirements of the subject.
If the drawing is to be made with a pen and is to consist of "line
work" the stone is polished. The first step is to obtain on the stone
an outline or "faint" of the design. There are several ways to do
this. By one method a tracing of the design is made, a sheet of
thin paper covered with red chalk is laid face downward on the
stone, the tracing is laid face downward over it, and the design is
again traced in red-chalk lines on the stone. The method described
is simple, but there are others that are more complicated and that
are particularly applicable to the reproduction of photographs and
other illustrations. Crayon work is often used in combination with
pen and ink, stipple, and brush work. This method of drawing on
stone is used also for preparing color stones in the process of chromolithography,
in which there are many added details of manipulation.
After the drawing has been made on the stone or transferred to it
the stone is "gummed"&mdash;that is, it is covered with a solution of
gum arabic and nitric acid&mdash;and dried. The stone is then dampened
with water and carefully rolled with lithographic ink, which adheres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to the pen or crayon work and is repelled elsewhere. It is
then "rubbed" over with powdered rosin and talcum, which adheres
to the ink and further protects the drawing from the effects of
the etching fluid, which is next to be applied to the stone. This fluid
consists of a 10 per cent solution of gum arabic to which 2 to 7 per
cent of nitric acid has been added, the degree of acidity being
varied according to the subject and the hardness of the stone. The
fluid is applied with a brush or sponge and is left on the stone
just long enough to decompose slightly the carbonate of lime on its
surface and, after washing, to leave the design or drawing in very
slight relief. The stone is again gummed and dried, and the design
is "washed out" or brought out by removing the surface gum with
a wet sponge and applying to the stone a rag sprinkled with turpentine
and charged with printing ink. These operations wash away the
tusche and the crayon that have been decomposed by the acid and
expose the design faintly in white at first, but it gradually grows
darker as it becomes charged with printing ink from the rag. The
stone is next "rolled up" or inked. The slightly moistened surface
repels the ink and the design takes it up, so that when the stone is
run through the press the design is carried to the paper.</p>

<p>Lithographic prints from stones prepared in this way are made
on a flat-bed press. The stone is carried forward to print and on its
return is dampened and inked, an operation slower than that of rotary
printing.</p>

<p>Corrections and changes are made on the stone by carefully scraping
or polishing away the parts to be corrected and making the
changes with a crayon or pen, but the design can not ordinarily be
corrected twice in the same place, as the scraping or polishing removes
a part of the surface of the stone and thus lessens the pressure
at that place, and the impression there may be imperfect or may
completely fail.</p>

<p>This form of lithography is seldom used for Survey illustrations
but was formerly much used and is well adapted to the reproduction
of drawings of fossils, particularly of remains of dinosaurs and other
types of large extinct animals. Examples may be seen in Monographs
8 and 10 and in other early reports of the Geological Survey. The
drawings for these illustrations were made directly on stone.</p>

<p>A drawing made on one stone may be transferred in duplicate or
in any desired number to another stone, or to a properly grained
sheet of zinc and aluminum, from which impressions may be printed
on a lithographic press. Both these metals are also used for lithographic
printing on rotary presses, the zinc or aluminum plate being
bent and secured around a cylinder which rotates continuously in
one direction. As one impression is made at each revolution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
cylinder the printing is rapid; but the best printing from a metal
plate is inferior to the best printing from a lithographic stone.</p>


<p class="caption3">PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY.</p>

<p>Photolithography, like other lithographic processes, has been improved
greatly during the last few years&mdash;not particularly in results
but in methods&mdash;by the introduction of metal plates, the rubber
blanket offset, the Ben Day films, and many mechanical and chemical
devices, so that a brief description of it will not explain the process
except in a most general way. As photolithography is a direct process
and is relatively cheap it is the one most used for reproducing
large maps and other line drawings that have been carefully prepared.
Zinc and aluminum plates are now much used in photolithography,
for a direct contact photographic print can be made on
them, they can be printed flat or bent for use on a rotary press, and
they can be stored for future use more economically than stones.</p>

<p>There are two somewhat distinct methods of producing photolithographs.
In both the ordinary photographic methods are used,
but it is often necessary to "cut" or trace parts of the negative in
order to open up lines and other features that are not sharp or well
defined, so that the negative will print them sharp and clear. If the
copy to be reproduced shows three colors, three negatives are made,
one for each color, and the parts to be shown by each are preserved
by "opaquing" or painting out all other parts. By the older method
the negative thus perfected is placed in a printing frame in contact,
under pressure, with sensitized transfer paper and is exposed to
light. The printing frame is then carried to the dark room and the
paper is removed from the frame and its surface covered with transfer
ink. The paper is then laid face upward on water and soaked
for several minutes, after which it is placed in the same position upon
a slab of stone or metal and thoroughly washed with water. This
washing removes the ink and the sensitive film from the parts that
were unaffected by the action of light (the parts corresponding to the
white paper in the design), but the ink still adheres to the lines of
the design in the precise sharpness and clearness of the negative.
The design is now ready to be transferred to the printing stone or
zinc plate. The sheet is again slightly dampened between moist
blotters and laid face downward in its correct position on a prepared
stone or zinc plate, which is then pulled through a press under heavy
pressure. The paper is then removed from the stone or plate, to
which it has carried the design. From this point the gumming,
etching, and other operations are practically the same as those used
in ordinary lithography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The bichromate-gelatin transfer process described above has been
replaced in the Survey by a more satisfactory one, which insures
absolute scale and reproduces the finest line drawings perfectly without
thickening the lines or without distortion. In this process, which
is known as the planographic process, a photographic negative of the
"copy" is placed in a vacuum printing frame in contact with a zinc
or aluminum plate that has been sensitized with a bichromate-albumen
solution and exposed in front of an arc lamp. After proper exposure
the plate is removed from the frame, inked over, and placed under
water. The parts not hardened by the action of light (the unexposed
parts) are then rubbed away with cotton, and the plate is chemically
etched, gummed over, and dried. The plate is then ready to be
printed from in a lithographic press. If a large map is to be reproduced
it is photographed in parts, and contact prints are made on
zinc plates. From these plates transfers are pulled and the parts are
assembled and laid down in proper position on a stone or an aluminum
plate, which is then prepared for printing.</p>

<p>A drawing that is to be reproduced by photolithography should be
made on pure-white paper in lines, dots, or black masses with black
waterproof ink. It should be one and one-half to two or three times
the size of the finished print.</p>

<p>Photolithography is particularly adapted to the reproduction of
maps, plans, and other large drawings. Within certain limitations,
lines may be changed and details may be added after proofs have
been submitted. The process is ordinarily used for reproducing
illustrations in one color (black), but it is used also for printing in
more than one color, generally over a black outline base, each color
being printed from a separate stone, as in chromolithography.</p>


<p class="caption3">OFFSET PRINTING.</p>

<p>In the offset process the design is "offset" from a lithographic
plate or stone to a rubber blanket on a cylinder, from which it is
printed. By thus obtaining an impression from an elastic surface
the finest details can be printed on rough, uncoated paper, which can
not be used in other processes, which can be folded without danger
of breaking, and which is more durable than coated paper. Plates
<a href="#Plate_II">II</a>, <a href="#Plate_III">III</a>,
<a href="#Plate_IV">IV</a>, <a href="#Plate_VII">VII</a>,
and <a href="#Plate_VIII">VIII</a> in this pamphlet were printed by this
process.</p>


<p class="caption3">CHROMOLITHOGRAPHY.</p>

<p>The chromolithographic process, by which illustrations are printed
in color from stone, is used in Survey publications principally for reproducing
geologic maps, but it is sometimes used for reproducing
colored drawings of specimens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several kinds of color printing from stones. One produces
a picture by superimposing colors that combine and overlap
without definite outlines and thus reproduce the softly blended colors
of the original. Another reproduces the original by printing colors
within definite outlines on a "base" which has been previously
printed in black. The first kind is used by the Survey for reproducing
colored drawings of specimens. The second is followed in
reproducing geologic maps.</p>

<p>As each color must be printed from a separate stone and properly
fitted with respect to the others a tracing from the original is made
of the precise outlines of each color; or, if the design is to be reduced,
a tracing is made over a properly reduced photographic print.
This tracing can be made on specially prepared tracing paper or on a
sheet of transparent gelatin or celluloid, which is laid over the copy
and on which all the outlines and overlaps of the various colors are
scratched with a steel point. The scratches thus made on the celluloid
are filled with red chalk or like substance, and rubbed in with cotton,
and by reversing the sheet and rubbing it the chalk lines are deposited
on as many stones as are needed to produce the colors of the original
design, each stone bearing all the outlines of the design. Sometimes
all the outlines are engraved on what is called a key stone and an
impression from it is laid down on each of the color stones. The
parts on each stone that are to have one color are then inked in or
engraved, and at the same time guide marks are indicated, so that in
the composite print from the stones each color will fit its proper place.
This fitting is called "register" and is an important part of printing,
for each stone must be adjusted to a nicety while on the press in order
to make each impression fit the others exactly. The process was originally
manipulated entirely by hand, but photography has now replaced
much of the handwork and has given rise to several methods
by which the same kinds of subjects are reproduced in radically
different ways. Tints are sometimes produced by the half-tone and
other screens and by machine ruling, and printer's type is used almost
exclusively for titles and other matter that was formerly engraved or
drawn on the stone.</p>

<p>In reproducing a geologic map the base may be engraved on stone
or on copper or it may be photo-lithographed. By either process the
map may be transferred to the printing stone. The color stones for
geologic maps are prepared by hand, but the geologic patterns, which
are printed in colors, are engraved separately on plates, from which
impressions are pulled when needed and transferred to their proper
places on the printing stones in the shapes required according to the
"key" design. The lighter, more transparent colors are generally
printed first, and often twelve or more colors and many distinctive
patterns are used to produce a geologic map. When proofs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of such a map are pulled each stone must be taken up and carefully
adjusted on the press, so that the work of proving maps that are
printed from a considerable number of color stones is laborious and
expensive. It is therefore customary to approve first combined proofs
conditionally&mdash;that is, subject to the corrections and changes indicated
on the proofs&mdash;and to hold the lithographer responsible for any
failure to make the corrections.</p>

<p>This process is the most expensive one used for reproducing illustrations.
Changes may be indicated on proofs, but changes can not
be made on a stone twice in the same place without danger of affecting
the printing or making it necessary to retransfer the parts affected.
All changes are expensive because a slight modification
at one point may involve corresponding changes on a number of
stones, each of which must be taken up, corrected, and proved to insure
the exact coincidence of the parts affected. It is often less expensive
to retransfer the entire job than to make extensive changes
on the original stones.</p>


<p class="caption3">ENGRAVING ON STONE AND ON COPPER.</p>

<p>Engraving on stone is distinctly lithographic, but engraving on
copper is sometimes included among lithographic processes because
the work produced by it is usually printed from stone and thus becomes
lithographic. In other respects engraving on copper is not a
lithographic process. Roughly prepared maps and any rough line
copy that is accurate in statement and clear as to intent are appropriate
for both methods of engraving, but drawings that are expertly
prepared are more suitable for reproduction by photolithography.
In engraving on stone the lines of a design are scratched on the
blackened surface of a stone with a steel-pointed tool; in engraving on
copper the lines are cut with a graver on a sheet or plate of copper,
the matter to be engraved being first shown on the plate by what is
called the photo-tracing process, which was devised in the Geological
Survey. There is, however, no great or essential difference in the
printed results of the two processes, but most lithographers employ
only stone engravers.</p>

<p>A stone on which a design is to be engraved is ground and polished
according to the kind of work to be engraved, is coated with a
thin solution of gum arable and allowed to dry, and is then washed
until the superficial gum is removed while the surface pores remain
filled. As the lines made by the engraver must be visible the stone is
blackened with a pigment composed of lampblack and gum or is
covered evenly with red chalk or Venetian red. It is then ready to
receive the design to be engraved.</p>

<p>If the design is a map which is to show culture, streams, and surface
contours, and each of these sets of features is to be printed in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
separate color, impressions of the work to be engraved must be placed
on three stones. One method of doing this is to make a scratch
tracing of the original drawing on a sheet of transparent gelatin
or celluloid in the manner employed in chromolithography, except
that a dry pigment, generally chrome-yellow, is used to fill the
scratch lines instead of red chalk or Venetian red. From this
tracing a "faint" or imprint of all the details of the three separate
features of the map is made on each of the three stones, and the engraver
then cuts on each stone only the lines and other features, including
ample register marks, that are to be printed in one color, the
imprint made from the tracing making it possible to engrave each set
of features in its exact position relative to the other two. By another
method the matter to be engraved is photographed directly on
the stone.</p>

<p>The engraving is done with a steel needle inserted in a small
wooden cylinder, an instrument resembling an ordinary lead pencil.
The size and shape of the needles used are varied according to the requirements
of the matter to be engraved. With this instrument the
lines and lettering are lightly scratched into the stone through the
dark coating and show as light lines. The points of some of the
needles are fine; those of others are V-shaped; and some have spoon-shaped
points, for use in thickening lines and shading letters. All
features are engraved in reverse.</p>

<p>After the engraving is completed the stones are prepared for printing
by wiping off all the superficial color and filling the engraved
lines with a greasy ink&mdash;generally a thin printing ink&mdash;which is
rubbed into the lines with a soft rag. Impressions are then pulled
on transfer paper and transferred to three printing stones for use in
printing the three colors, the register marks enabling the pressman
to fit each color exactly in its proper place.</p>

<p>In all lithographic processes the titles and other marginal lettering
can be and usually are transferred from type impressions to the
printing stones. It is therefore unnecessary to letter such matter
carefully on an original drawing that is made for lithographic reproduction,
for appropriate faces of type will give better printed results
than hand lettering.</p>

<p>Corrections can not be made on a stone or copper engraving as
readily as on a drawing. If a stone engraver makes an error or if a
change is required after his engraving is finished, the parts to be
corrected must be scraped off and a new ground laid before the correction
can be made. Sometimes he will engrave the parts corrected on
another part of the original stone and transfer it to the printing
stone. Corrections are made on copper plates by "hammering up"
the plate from beneath, polishing off a new surface, and reengraving
the part to be corrected.</p>

<p>The following list was prepared in the geologic branch for the use
of geologic draftsmen to enable them to select appropriate symbols
for rocks that may be referred to in preliminary drawings by name
only. For sedimentary rocks dots and circles, parallel lines, and
broken or dotted lines are used; for metamorphic rocks short dashes
arranged without definite patterns; and for igneous rocks patterns
composed of short dashes, triangles, rhombs, crosses, and cross lines.
All these patterns are shown in <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>.</p>
